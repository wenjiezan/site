      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your father is about to ask me the question. This is the most important moment in our lives, and I want to pay attention, note every detail. Your dad and I have just come back from an evening out, dinner and a show; it&#39;s after midnight. We came out onto the patio to look at the full moon; then I told your dad I wanted to dance, so he humors me and now we&#39;re slow-dancing, a pair of thirtysomethings swaying back and forth in the moon-light like kids. I don&#39;t feel the night chill at all. And then your dad says, &#34;Do you want to make a baby?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Superiority</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IN MAKING THIS STATEMENT—which I do of my own free will—I wish first to make it perfectly clear that I am not in any way trying to gain sympathy, nor do I expect any mitigation of whatever sentence the Court may pronounce. I am writing this in an attempt to refute some of the lying reports broadcast over the prison radio and published in the papers I have been allowed to see. These have given an entirely false picture of the true cause of our defeat, and as the leader of my race&#39;s armed forces at the cessation of hostilities I feel it my duty to protest against such libels upon those who served under me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction</title>
      <link>https://wenjiezan.github.io/site/library/guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the temperate and tropical regions where it appears that hominids evolved into human beings, the principal food of the species was vegetable. Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food. The mammoth hunters spectacularly occupy the cave wall and the mind, but what we actually did to stay alive and fat was gather seeds, roots, sprouts, shoots, leaves, nuts, berries, fruits, and grains, adding bugs and mollusks and netting or snaring birds, fish, rats, rabbits, and other tuskless small fry to up the protein. And we didn&#39;t even work hard at it— much less hard than peasants slaving in somebody else&#39;s field after agriculture was invented, much less hard than paid workers since civilization was invented. The average prehistoric person could make a nice living in about a fifteen-hour work week. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Creatures That Time Forgot (or &#34;Frost and Fire&#34;)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the night, Sim was born. He lay wailing upon the cold cave stones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He grew, steadily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The nightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew alert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright, insistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked about, blindly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 style=&#34;text-align:center!important;&#34;&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thought that Anderton had when he saw the young man was: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m getting bald. Bald and fat and old. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But he didn&#39;t say it aloud. Instead, he pushed back his chair, got to his feet, and came resolutely around the side of his desk, his right hand rigidly extended. Smiling with forced amiability, he shook hands with the young man. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Witwer?” he asked, managing to make this query sound gracious. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Night (or &#34;Ice Cream on a Summer&#39;s Evening&#34;)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night is more than darkness; it is life and death and all things beyond our feeble knowledges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are a child in a small town. You are, to be exact, eight years old, and it is growing late at night. Late, for you, accustomed to bedding in at nine or nine-thirty; once in a while perhaps begging Mom or Dad to let you stay up later to hear Sam and Henry on that strange radio that was popular in this year of 1927. But most of the time you are in bed and snug at this time of night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next time you see the full moon high in the south, look carefully at its right-hand edge and let your eye travel upward along the curve of the disk. Round about two o’clock you will notice a small, dark oval: anyone with normal eyesight can find it quite easily. It is the great walled plain, one of the finest on the Moon, known as the Mare Crisium-the Sea of Crises. Three hundred miles in diameter, and almost completely surrounded by a ring of magnificent mountains, it had never been explored until we entered it in the late summer of 1996.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is three thousand light-years to the Vatican. Once, I believed that space could have no power over faith, just as I believed the heavens declared the glory of God’s handwork. Now I have seen that handiwork, and my faith is sorely troubled. I stare at the crucifix that hangs on the cabin wall above the Mark VI Computer, and for the first time in my life I wonder if it is no more than an empty symbol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the living room the voice-clock sang, &lt;em&gt;Tick-tock, seven o&#39;clock, time to get up, time to get up, seven o&#39;clock!&lt;/em&gt; as if it were afraid nobody would. The morning house lay empty. The clock ticked on, repeating and repeating its sounds into the emptiness. &lt;em&gt;Seven-nine, breakfast time, seven-nine!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing sigh and ejected from its warm interior eight pieces of perfectly browned toast, eight eggs sunnyside up, sixteen slices of bacon, two coffees, and two cool glasses of milk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HE AWOKE—and wanted Mars. The valleys, he thought. What would it be like to trudge among them? Great and greater yet: the dream grew as he became fully conscious, the dream and the yearning. He could almost feel the enveloping presence of the other world, which only Government agents and high officials had seen. A clerk like himself? Not likely. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Are you getting up or not?&#34; his wife Kirsten asked drowsily, with her usual hint of fierce crossness. &#34;If you are, push the hot coffee button on the darn stove.&#34; &lt;/p&gt;</description>
