Earth\u0026rsquo;s moon actually has a diameter more than 100 times greater than the larger Martian moon, Phobos. However, the Martian moons orbit much closer to their planet than the distance between Earth and Earth\u0026rsquo;s moon.\nDeimos, at far left, and Phobos, beside it, are shown together as they actually were photographed by the Mast Camera (Mastcam) NASA\u0026rsquo;s Mars rover Curiosity on Aug. 1, 2013. The images are oriented so that north is up. The size-comparison image of Earth\u0026rsquo;s moon, on the right, is also oriented with north up.\nDeimos has a diameter of 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) and was 12,800 miles (20,500 kilometers) from the rover at the time of the image. Phobos has a diameter 14 miles (22 kilometers) and was 3,900 miles (6,240 kilometers) from the rover at the time of the image. Earth\u0026rsquo;s moon has a diameter of 2,159 miles (3,474 kilometers) and is typically about 238,000 miles (380,000 kilometers) from an observer on Earth.\nVideo, https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA13737\nThe larger of the two moons of Mars, Phobos, transits (passes in front of) the sun in this approximately true-speed movie simulation using images from the panoramic camera (Pancam) on NASA\u0026rsquo;s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity taken on the rover\u0026rsquo;s 2,415th Martian day, or sol (Nov. 9, 2010). The movie includes images that have been calibrated and enhanced, plus simulated frames used to smooth the action. Images of solar transits of Phobos and the other Mars moon, Deimos, taken over many years by Mars rovers aid in studies of slight changes in the moons\u0026rsquo; orbits.\nThis movie is based on 10 individual photos taken through the Pancam\u0026rsquo;s special solar filter every four seconds during the transit, which lasted about 32 seconds. The images were gradually blended together to create a simulated near-real-speed animation of the event. The moviemakers supplemented those images with sky color information from a pair of images taken right after the transit through two regular imaging filters: one centered on a wavelength of 440 nanometers (blue) and the other on 750 nanometers (near infrared). The silhouette of Phobos looks smaller than in some other Mars rover transit images (for example, PIA05554) because when Phobos is near the horizon it is more than 30 percent farther from the camera\u0026rsquo;s location than when it is straight overhead.\nAlbedo and brightness # Phobos in itself is rather dark, but it has an albedo similar to the Earth\u0026rsquo;s Moon. Considering also the relative apparent size (Moon: 0.5°, Phobos: 0.2°), a full Phobos in a clear sky should illuminate as much as a half-full moon.\nThis seems to be a random picture from Mars Express of so little value that I could not locate a source other than a forum post. Apparently the source for OP was a now dead FTP folder dump of the HRSC: http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?s=50e274fb401c38cab101ba75a3e1c9cf\u0026showtopic=480\u0026st=195\u0026p=167059\u0026#entry167059. However, a \u0026ldquo;sister\u0026rdquo; picture was later published on APOD (https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101201.html)\nHere a mirror of ESA\u0026rsquo;s FTP archives (HRSC, orbit n.7982): https://archives.esac.esa.int/psa/ftp/MARS-EXPRESS/HRSC/MEX-M-HRSC-3-RDR-EXT3-V4.0/BROWSE/7982/H7982_0000_ND3.JPG\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06340\nTaking advantage of extra solar energy collected during the day, NASA\u0026rsquo;s Mars Exploration Rover Spirit recently settled in for an evening of stargazing, photographing the two moons of Mars as they crossed the night sky. In this view, the Pleiades, a star cluster also known as the \u0026ldquo;Seven Sisters,\u0026rdquo; is visible in the lower left corner. The bright star Aldebaran and some of the stars in the constellation Taurus are visible on the right. Spirit acquired this image the evening of martian day, or sol, 590 (Aug. 30, 2005). The image on the right provides an enhanced-contrast view with annotation. Within the enhanced halo of light is an insert of an unsaturated view of Phobos taken a few images later in the same sequence.\n\u0026ldquo;It is incredibly cool to be running an observatory on another planet,\u0026rdquo; said planetary scientist Jim Bell of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., lead scientist for the panoramic cameras on Spirit and Opportunity. In the annotated animation (figure 2), both martian moons, Deimos on the left and Phobos on the right, travel across the night sky in front of the constellation Sagittarius. Part of Sagittarius resembles an upside-down teapot. In this view, Phobos moves toward the handle and Deimos moves toward the lid. Phobos is the brighter object on the right; Deimos is on the left. Each of the stars in Sagittarius is labeled with its formal name. The inset shows an enlarged, enhanced view of Phobos, shaped rather like a potato with a hole near one end. The hole is the large impact creater Stickney, visible on the moon\u0026rsquo;s upper right limb.\nOn Mars, Phobos would be easily visible to the naked eye at night, but would be only about one-third as large as the full Moon appears from Earth. Astronauts staring at Phobos from the surface of Mars would notice its oblong, potato-like shape and that it moves quickly against the background stars. Phobos takes only 7 hours, 39 minutes to complete one orbit of Mars. That is so fast, relative to the 24-hour-and-39-minute sol on Mars (the length of time it takes for Mars to complete one rotation), that Phobos rises in the west and sets in the east. Earth\u0026rsquo;s moon, by comparison, rises in the east and sets in the west. The smaller martian moon, Deimos, takes 30 hours, 12 minutes to complete one orbit of Mars. That orbital period is longer than a martian sol, and so Deimos rises, like most solar system moons, in the east and sets in the west.\nScientists will use images of the two moons to better map their orbital positions, learn more about their composition, and monitor the presence of nighttime clouds or haze. Spirit took the five images that make up this composite with the panoramic camera, using the camera\u0026rsquo;s broadband filter, which was designed specifically for acquiring images under low-light conditions.\nSolar eclipses by Phobos # Phobos orbits very quickly and in the opposite direction from the Sun. It also eclipses it regularly. This means that Phobos\u0026rsquo; shadow should be visible from Phobos itself on the Martian surface.\nFrom Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Phobos_from_Mars\nA transit of Phobos from Mars usually lasts only thirty seconds or so, due to the moon\u0026rsquo;s very rapid orbital period of about 7.6 hours.\nBecause Phobos orbits close to Mars and in line with its equator, transits of Phobos occur somewhere on Mars on most days of the Martian year. Its orbital inclination is 1.08°, so the latitude of its shadow projected onto the Martian surface shows a seasonal variation, moving from 70.4°S to 70.4°N and back again over the course of a Martian year. Phobos is so close to Mars that it is not visible south of 70.4°S or north of 70.4°N; for some days in the year, its shadow misses the surface entirely and falls north or south of Mars.\nAt any given geographical location on the surface of Mars, there are two intervals in a Martian year when the shadow of Phobos or Deimos is passing through its latitude. During each such interval, about half a dozen transits of Phobos can be seen by observers at that geographical location (compared to zero or one transits of Deimos). Transits of Phobos happen during Martian autumn and winter in the respective hemisphere; close to the equator they happen around the March and September equinoxes, while farther from the equator they happen closer to the winter solstice.\nObservers at high latitudes (but less than 70.4°) will see a noticeably smaller angular diameter for Phobos because they are considerably farther away from it than observers at Mars\u0026rsquo;s equator. As a result, transits of Phobos for such observers will cover less of the Sun\u0026rsquo;s disk. Because it orbits so close to Mars, Phobos cannot be seen north of 70.4°N or south of 70.4°S; observers at such latitudes will obviously not see transits, either.\nLunar eclipses # WIP.

For comparison, the Sun as seed from Earth is only 32\u0026rsquo;. Knowing that the human field of view is 210° horizontal and 150° vertical, the Martian disk can be seen in full, even considering that binocular vision only spans for 120°H-60°V.\nMars from Phobos, aperture 90°:\nFrom NASA\u0026rsquo;s simulator at https://space.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/wspace?tbody=499\u0026vbody=401\u0026month=4\u0026day=28\u0026year=2023\u0026hour=00\u0026minute=00\u0026fovmul=1\u0026rfov=90\u0026bfov=30\u0026showac=1\nPhobos shadow as seen from Phobos # Regarding the possibility to see Phobos\u0026rsquo; shadow on Mars from Phobos itself:\nViewed from orbit, the penumbral shadow of Phobos can be seen to move rapidly over the Martian surface. This shadow on the Martian surface has been photographed on many occasions by Mars Global Surveyor. In the 1970s, the Viking 1 Lander and Orbiter photographed the shadow as well. The Lander detected the penumbral shadow of Phobos passing across it. This was detected only as a slight dimming of the ambient light; the Viking 1 Lander camera did not image the Sun. The shadow took about 20 seconds to pass over the Lander, moving at about 2 km/s. The shadow was simultaneously imaged from the Viking 1 Orbiter, which permitted locating the position of the lander in the orbiter pictures.\nhttps://www.planetary.org/space-images/phobos-shadow-transits-mars\nPhobos\u0026rsquo; shadow transits Mars In a six-frame animation spanning 15 minutes over January 30-31, 2010, the Mars Express Visual Monitoring Camera observed Phobos\u0026rsquo; shadow transiting Mars. It is late autumn in Mars\u0026rsquo; southern hemisphere, so the shadow of Phobos (which orbits exactly along Mars\u0026rsquo; equatorial plane) falls on Mars\u0026rsquo; high southern latitudes. Mars Express is looking down nearly onto Mars\u0026rsquo; south pole, which is in winter darkness; the bright splat at the center of the animation is the Argyre impact basin, with the crater Galle located on its rim. Phobos\u0026rsquo; shadow crosses northern Argyre and proceeds across Noachis terra. This is the first time that VMC was known to have imaged Phobos\u0026rsquo; shadow.\nNote that it\u0026rsquo;s very small, barely visible in the gif itself. However it\u0026rsquo;s useful to have an idea of the speed of such transit.\nHere another video: Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry3HYHpnURI ( backup ) Found at: https://www.planetary.org/articles/2830\nViking 1 observes a dust storm and Phobos\u0026rsquo; shadow On September 28, 1977, Viking Orbiter 1 observed a dust storm over the site where it had dropped its lander, a little more than a year previously. As Viking 1 orbiter watched, the shadow of Mars\u0026rsquo; inner moon Phobos passed over the cloud tops. The sequence of images has been artificially colorized and is displayed at a speed ten times that of real time. (Viking images f467a31 - f467a69)\nThis one shows even better how hard it is to see the shadow. It\u0026rsquo;s best to consider it not really visible.\nMSSS Mars Global Surveyor, 1999\nFrom Wikimedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phobos_shadow.jpg Part of https://asimov.msss.com/moc_gallery/ab1_m04/images/M0403241.html and https://asimov.msss.com/moc_gallery/ab1_m04/images/M0403242.html\nThe penumbral shadow of Phobos is visible on the landscape of Mars, as photographed by the Mars Global Surveyor. The center of the shadow was at approximately 10.9°N 49.2°W (Map of area Map zoom) at 04:00:33.3 UTC Earth time.\nThe image shows western Xanthe Terra on August 26 1999 at about 2:41 p.m. local solar time on Mars. The image covers an area about 250 kilometers across and is illuminated from the left. The dark spots on the crater floors are probably dark sand dunes. None of the craters pictured currently have names. Nanedi Valles is the meandering valley at the bottom right. The picture covers about 7°\u0026ndash;15°N vertically and 52°\u0026ndash;48°W horizontally. The vertical orientation of the image is 3.01° to the west of north; a north-pointing arrow superimposed on the image would point slightly to the right.\nTo determine the time of the shadow, we can look up the original image files at M04-03241 (red) https://asimov.msss.com/moc_gallery/ab1_m04/nonmaps/M0403241.gif and M04-03242 (blue) https://asimov.msss.com/moc_gallery/ab1_m04/nonmaps/M0403242.gif. The \u0026ldquo;image start time\u0026rdquo; was 03:26:13.01 UTC, the \u0026quot;line integration time\u0026quot; is 80.4800 milliseconds, and the \u0026quot;downtrack summing\u0026quot; factor is 4. Since the shadow is centered at 6400 pixels from the bottom of the original 10800-pixel-high image (Mars Global Surveyor had a south-to-north sun-synchronous orbit), we add (6400 * 0.08048 * 4) = 2060.3 seconds = 34 minutes 20.3 seconds to get a time of 04:00:33.3 UTC for the center of the shadow.\nAncillary data for MOC wide-angle image M04-03241 Acquisition parameters Image ID (picno): M04-03241 Image start time: 1999-08-26T03:26:13.01 SCET Image width: 256 pixels Image height: 10800 pixels Line integration time: 80.4800 millisec Pixel aspect ratio: 1.03 Crosstrack summing: 4 Downtrack summing: 4 Compression type: MOC-NONE Gain mode: 3A (hexadecimal) Offset mode: 5 (decimal) Derived values Longitude of image center: 47.47°W Latitude of image center: 5.68°S Scaled pixel width: 961.72 meters Scaled image width: 258.01 km Scaled image height: 10556.75 km Solar longitude (Ls): 194.55° Local True Solar Time: 14.25 decimal hours Emission angle: 3.54° Incidence angle: 40.67° Phase angle: 37.14° North azimuth: 93.01° Sun azimuth: 0.17° Spacecraft altitude: 380.63 km Slant distance: 381.29 km The shadow of Phobos, from the images and the data, is about 90px * 1000m = 9km, so really really small with respect to the size of the disk. The size of the Martian disk from Phobos is apparent size = diameter/distance * 3438 arcminutes = 9km / 9000km * 3438 ~= 3'\nFor comparison, Venus or the ISS are about 1\u0026rsquo;. However, they are bright, which makes them a lot more visible. Considering that Mars itself is bright and the shadow only penumbral, it\u0026rsquo;s probly quite hard to spot, even if it moves.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/site/docs/solar-system/50-mars/noctis/","title":"Noctis Labyrinthus","section":"Mars","content":" Sources: # Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctis_Labyrinthus Local Geology # USGS Geological map data # From Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore_resources_on_Mars:\nThe abundance of volcanic features together with widespread cratering are strong evidence for a variety of ores.\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239594538_Potential_martian_mineral_resources_Mechanisms_and_terrestrial_analogues\nThe USGS geological map shows several different regions in the Noctis area:\nNoctis seems to be a primarily volcanic region, with compression features, graben and other types of folds and cracks due to tectonical stress, a huge crater (Oudemans) with moraines and landslides and smaller craters nearby, plus signs of eolic and fluvial erosion, so probably also some sedimentary rocks. It\u0026rsquo;s not evident whether the region is carsic, but I doubt we currently know which regions were carsic on Mars when (if) surface water was present. The presence of signs of fluvial erosion might be already a good sign.\nRegarding the volcanic nature of the region: Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctis_Labyrinthus quotes \u0026ldquo;Volcanic rifting at Martian grabens\u0026rdquo;, Mège, Daniel; Cook, Anthony; Garel, Erwan; Lagabrielle, Y http://pure.aber.ac.uk/ws/files/89581/2002JE001852.pdf ( backup )\nNoctis Labyrinthus is estimated to have experienced collapses from the drainage of magma chambers up to 5 km below the chasmata floors. In Noctis Labyrinthus in particular, some researchers have speculated that the fracture zone\u0026rsquo;s corridors may connect deeper intrusive structures, forming a plumbing network more akin to the terrestrial Thulean mantle plume, which was responsible for the formation of the North Atlantic Igneous Province. In the chasmata of Noctis Labyrinthus, these pit crater chain collapse zones propagate directionally with a V-shaped tip, and can be used as an indicator of the direction into which magma withdraws from its underlying chamber. These V-tipped morphologies are generally found to propagate away from the center of the Tharsis Rise.\nOthers have proposed that the chasmata of Noctis Labyrinthus are collapse features of a karstic nature, in which constituent carbonate rock is dissolved by meteoric water that has been acidified by acids originating in volcanic gases. This hypothesis has been challenged because carbonate spectral signatures have not been detected in the Noctis Labyrinthus network.\nWikipedia adds that:\nNo evidence of fluvial or aeolian erosion is observed in this region.\nHowever, the source is seriously old: Masson, P. (1980), \u0026ldquo;Contribution to the Structural Interpretation of the Valles Marineris-Noctis Labyrinthus-Claritas Fossae Regions of Mars\u0026rdquo;. https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1980M%26P....22..211M ( backup )\nAnd later adds that:\nAn unnamed depression near the southernmost extent of the Noctis Labyrinthus system, near the divide of Syria Planum and Sinai Planum and at the western end of the Valles Marineris (at 10.4°S, 98.6°W) was found to be one of the most mineralogically diverse sites yet observed on the planet. These deposits, dated to the late Hesperian, post-date most Martian deposits of hydrated minerals. Based on CRISM spectral imagery, authors studying this depression have interpretatively identified the presence of:\niron-rich minerals such as hematite and goethite Polyhydrated iron sulfates (copiapite and coquimbite), monohydrated iron sulfates (szomolnokite and possibly kieserite), hydroxylated iron sulfates (melanterite and hydronium jarosite), and possibly anhydrous iron sulfates (mikasaite). aluminum phyllosilicates (kaolinites like hydrated halloysite/endeillite, or perhaps a combination of kaolinite and montmorillonite) iron smectites (nontronite) opaline silica (opal-A to the diagenetically-altered opal-CT), found to be comparable in spectral signature to some Icelandic volcanic glass lapilli Of the hydrated iron sulfate minerals observed in the basin, some of them - such as ferricopiapite - are not stable in modern Martian conditions. However, researchers have suggested that they appear to coexist because the different deposits may have been exposed to the open atmosphere at different times, and some of these minerals do only fully dehydrate under Martian conditions over the course of many years. Furthermore, opaline silica deposits observed within this depression display spectra that may occasionally suggest interpersal with the iron sulfate mineral jarosite and the phyllosilicate mineral montmorillonite. The latter material is interpreted as such from an unusual doublet shape resolved on its spectra.\nThe minerals in this basin were most likely formed as a result of an initially acidic hydrothermal alteration of basaltic terrain, with the dissolution of plagioclase and calcium-rich pyroxenes increasing the pH steadily and causing the other minerals to precipitate. In this basin in particular, the mafic smectite layer overlays sulfates, aluminum phyllosilicate clays, and opaline silica deposits. The order of this layering is unique to the unnamed depression and is typically reversed in most Martian contexts, with the mafic smectites forming the bottom Noachian-age layer. Some researchers have counterproposed that rather than a sequentially reversed depositional event, this basin formed in a single, highly heterogeneous event. This is not necessarily indicative of a global alterational phenomenon, but is most likely tied to a localized heat source such as a volcano or an impact crater.\nCalcium-rich pyroxenes have been spectrally observed elsewhere in the northern reaches of the Noctis Labyrinthus fracture zone.\u0026quot;\nUnnamed depression mentioned in the study: 10.4°S, 98.6°W.\nAnother reference however is \u0026ldquo;Most Mars minerals in a nutshell: Various alteration phases formed in a single environment in Noctis Labyrinthus\u0026rdquo;, P. Thollot et al., 21 April 2012 https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011JE004028\nThis is much more recent that the other study that states that no sign of fluvial or eolic phenomena was found in the area.\nSurface features # Lava tubes # See Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_tube\nTharsis and Noctis seems to be full of these features (see Atlas of Mars).\nSurface renderings # https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA13655\nWest of Valles Marineris lies a checkerboard named Noctis Labyrinthus, which formed when the Martian crust stretched and fractured. As faults opened, they released subsurface ice and water, causing the ground to collapse. This westward view combines images taken during the period from April 2003 to September 2005 by the Thermal Emission Imaging System instrument on NASA\u0026rsquo;s Mars Odyssey orbiter. It is part of a special set of images marking the occasion of Odyssey becoming the longest-working Mars spacecraft in history. The pictured location on Mars is 13.3 degrees south latitude, 263.4 degrees east longitude.\nFrom FU Berlin\u0026rsquo;s press release on Noctis: https://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/geol/fachrichtungen/planet/press/archiv2016/noctis_labyrinthus1/index.html ( backup )\nIn many places, the steep valley slopes and the valley floor are covered with extensive landslides. Elsewhere, as can be seen well in these images on closer inspection, the slopes appear to be largely covered by massive wind deposits. The regular linear structures on the valley slopes visible on the left and right edges of the images can be interpreted as dune crests. From the alignment of the crests, it can be deduced that in some places, sand has been transported down the slope, while in other places, uphill transportation of the dune sand has taken place.\nIn every case, these surface structures created by the wind are no longer active. This is indicated not only by the consistent covering of red Martian dust (active dunes on Mars would be dark grey in appearance as they generally consist of old volcanic dust), but also by the presence of several small impact craters [\u0026hellip;] If the dunes are old and have hardened over the course of time, however, meteorites can leave small craters behind.\nThey also released a video here https://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/geol/fachrichtungen/planet/presse/animations_rd/2023_NoctisLabyrinthus/index.html ( backup )\nThis mosaic image is combined with topography information from a digital terrain model (DTM) to generate a three-dimensional landscape.

CRISM spectra suggest a general sulfate mineralogy for the light-toned deposit. However, the beds differ in brightness, color, thickness, and erosional properties, suggesting that many compositions may be present here but are too thin to be resolved. (Credit: NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/The University of Arizona)\nWeitz and her team identified various types of clays, hydrated silicas, and sulfates in these small basins, which are typically 30 to 100 kilometers across. One LTD included dozens of beds of varying thickness, brightness, color and erosional structure, suggesting that significant amounts of water once existed there. In addition, sulfates were mixed with clays within the deposits, indicating that ph levels may have fluctuated between acidic and alkaline conditions.\nAnother LTD is buried several meters beneath wind-deposited material and is only exposed in the trough\u0026rsquo;s upper walls, indicating it is older than the trough. In still another area, clays are buried beneath younger plains along the trough floor, while in the same trough, but a few kilometers away, there are exposures of hydrated silica and calcium sulfate.\nThe wide variability in deposits and mineralogy in these and the other basins suggests a complex hydrologic history, including multiple events in some troughs, Weitz said.\nLayers in Noctis Labyrinthus (crop from the original)\nhttps://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_049297_1715\nNoctis\u0026rsquo; Graben, MSSS.

The mosaic combines visible wavelength images made during daytime with nighttime infrared images. The nighttime view records the predawn temperature of the surface. This data can tell scientists about the nature of the materials on the ground. [..] At the foot of the slope, however, lie the traces of older, more substantial avalanches that piled up rocks and large debris. As such rockslides slow their fall and halt, they pile up ramparts that resemble the \u0026ldquo;toes\u0026rdquo; seen on the canyon floor. [\u0026hellip;]\nIn the canyon bottom lies a curious deposit whose origin is unclear. Measurements by THEMIS show this material has a temperature of -70° Celsius (-100° Fahrenheit). While this is extremely cold by Earth standards, in martian terms it\u0026rsquo;s comparatively warm, especially in contrast to the dust on the canyon rim, which has a temperature of -115° C (-175° F).\nSince the warm deposit lies where many landslide toes meet and merge, it\u0026rsquo;s a good guess the material contains a lot of rocks. Yet this may not tell the complete story. In places, the deposit resembles wind-eroded features called yardangs, seen in many places on Mars.\nYardangs, which also occur in terrestrial desert regions, form as strong winds erode soft sediments. Typically, yardangs show as low, elongated bumps or hills that align with the prevailing wind direction.\nComplicating the story is the fact that in the bottom of Valles Marineris and within dozens of martian craters and canyons, scientists see older material laid down in layers and now exposed by erosion. The deposits seen here partly resemble those layered sediments.\nSo is the warm, rock-rich material in the canyon bottom a mingling of landslide toes? Does it also embody wind-sculpted sediments? Or is this some unknown older material emerging as the canyon walls erode? No one can yet say - and its origin might even combine all these in some way. Stay tuned.\nRelic glacier # On the south eastern edge of Noctis Labyrinthus, scientists located what is likely to be a relic glacier, i.e. the remains of what was formerly a glacier.\nNews article: https://www.universetoday.com/160642/remnants-of-a-relict-glacier-found-near-the-equator-on-mars/ ( backup )\n[\u0026hellip;] Scientists studying the surface of Mars discovered a relict glacier near the planet’s equator. The relict glacier could signal the presence of buried water ice at the planet’s mid-latitudes.\nSome areas of the Martian surface are known for light-toned deposits (LTDs.) NASA’s Viking spacecraft spotted them in the late 1970s. Since then, scientists have found them in Valles Marineris, Hebes Chasma, and in other locations on Mars. Their unusual features have captured the attention of researchers who want to understand how they formed. While LTDs are named for their colour, that’s not the only way they differ. Their surfaces can set them apart from their surroundings, too. The top of LTDs can be rough, in contrast to their smooth-surfaced surroundings.\nAs scientists have worked to piece together Mars’ geological history, they’ve tried to understand what exactly LTDs are and where they fit in the timeline. In a 2008 paper, researchers presented evidence that some LTDs are vestiges of large-scale spring deposits. Different teams of researchers have examined the LTDs and reached different conclusions. Some concluded that they’re lacustrine deposits, some suggested they’re made of deposits eroded from walls, some thought they’re aeolian deposits, and some even suggested that they’re volcanic deposits. [\u0026hellip;]\n“What we’ve found is not ice, but a salt deposit with the detailed morphologic features of a glacier. What we think happened here is that salt formed on top of a glacier while preserving the shape of the ice below, down to details like crevasse fields and moraine bands,” said Dr. Lee.\n[\u0026hellip;] When pyroclastic materials, including ash, pumice, and lava, erupted from volcanoes, they landed on top of the ancient glacier. When they contacted the ice, chemical reactions would’ve occurred that formed a thick layer of sulphate salts like the ones in Mars’ LTDs. The sulphate salts would’ve formed a hardened layer moulded to the surface of the ice. Over long periods of time, the volcanic material covering the glacier eroded. What’s left is the layer of sulphate salts, preserving the form of the original underlying glacier. [\u0026hellip;]\nOver time, craters have impacted the region, but only lightly. That means the features are geologically young, likely from Mars’ Amazonian Age, the most recent age that also includes modern Mars. [\u0026hellip;]\nThere’s no surface ice here. The ice in the glacier may have all sublimated, or some of it might persist under the sulphate cap. “Water ice is, at present, not stable at the very surface of Mars near the equator at these elevations. So, it’s not surprising that we’re not detecting any water ice at the surface. It is possible that all the glacier’s water ice has sublimated away by now. But there’s also a chance that some of it might still be protected at shallow depth under the sulphate salts,” said Lee.\nActual publication (2023): https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369369563_A_RELICT_GLACIER_NEAR_MARS%27_EQUATOR_EVIDENCE_FOR_RECENT_GLACIATION_AND_VOLCANISM_IN_EASTERN_NOCTIS_LABYRINTHUS ( backup)\nNoctis Landing # The Noctis Landing site is the name given around 2015 to the large depression between Noctis Labyrinthus and Ius Chasma.

It\u0026rsquo;s at a decent distance from Tithonium (steeper than Noctis in some locations), not too far from Dragon Pit and relatively close to a feature that might indeed resempre a fox\u0026rsquo;s head (from which the other wells of North Complex are named).\nThere are other images in the archives such as noctis-landing-valley-landscape-1.png.

Batson, P.M. Bridges, and J.L. Inge, of the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Arizona. This was a compendium of airbrushed shaded relief maps, controlled photomosaics, and in a few cases albedo (shading) maps, mostly assembled from Mariner 9 survey images, with some gaps filled by Viking orbiter images. The planet was divided into thirty \u0026ldquo;quadrangles\u0026rdquo; or areas, each with an \u0026ldquo;Mars Chart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;MC\u0026rdquo; number (MC-1 through MC-30). The equatorial region was portrayed in the Mercator projection, with Lambert Conformal Conic for the mid-latitudes and Polar Stereographic for the poles.\nAlthough digital products such as the Mars Digital Image Mosaic (MDIM) and various Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) maps have partially supplanted the ATLAS, it remains a standard desktop reference today.\nIn 1999, the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) aboard the MGS orbiter acquired a global stereo image dataset using its red-filter Wide Angle Camera. We have recently completed a 256 pixel/degree (about 230 meters/pixel) mosaic of these images using software developed at Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS).

Assuming 1Gy = 1Sv (may be roughly ok given that we\u0026rsquo;re talking about background radiation), a year on Mars exposes people easily to radiation levels that have a clear correlation with cancer risk.\nMinimal annual dose linked to cancer risk: 100mSv.\nReference: https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/news/2020/low-dose-monograph,where \u0026ldquo;low dose\u0026rdquo; is defined as \u0026lt; 100 mGy\nM.

The upper portion of this graphic shows the increase in protons in two ranges of energy levels (15- to-100 million electron volts and 80-to-220 million electron volts), as recorded by the Solar Energetic Particle instrument on NASA\u0026rsquo;s on NASA\u0026rsquo;s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution orbiter, or MAVEN. The lower portion shows the radiation dose on the Martian surface, in micrograys per day, as measured by the Radiation Assessment Monitor instrument on NASA\u0026rsquo; Curiosity Mars rover. Micrograys are unit of measurement for absorbed radiation dose.\nNote that only protons in the higher bracket of energy levels penetrate the atmosphere enough to be detected on the surface.\nAccording to Wikipedia, the surface equivalent dose rate is of 27 uSv/h, so 27 uSv/h * 24h = 648 uSv/day = 0.65 mSv/day (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1244797)\nAnnual dose on the martian surface: ~0.3mG * 365 ~= 100mG/y, and 0.65mSv * 365 ~= 237mSv/y about 5 times the max limit for exposure on the workplace and more than double than the minimum of annual radiation exposure clearly linked to cancer development.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17601\nMeasurements with the MSL Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on NASA\u0026rsquo;s Curiosity Mars rover during the flight to Mars and now on the surface of Mars enable an estimate of the radiation astronauts would be exposed to on an expedition to Mars. NASA reference missions reckon with durations of 180 days for the trip to Mars, a 500-day stay on Mars, and another 180-day trip back to Earth. RAD measurements inside shielding provided by the spacecraft show that such a mission would result in a radiation exposure of about 1 sievert, with roughly equal contributions from the three stages of the expedition. A Sievert is a measurement unit of radiation exposure to biological tissue. This graphic shows the estimated amounts for humans on a Mars mission and amounts for some other activities.\nFor reference: https://xkcd.com/radiation/ 237mSv is already in the red zone.\nSoil toxicity # From Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_soil:\nMartian soil is toxic, due to relatively high concentrations of perchlorate compounds containing chlorine. [...]\nThe report noted that one of the types of plant studied, Eichhornia crassipes, seemed resistant to the perchlorates and could be used to help remove the toxic salts from the environment, although the plants themselves would end up containing a high concentration of perchlorates as a result. There is evidence that some bacterial lifeforms are able to overcome perchlorates by physiological adaptations to increasing perchlorate concentrations, and some even live off them. However, the added effect of the high levels of UV reaching the surface of Mars breaks the molecular bonds, creating even more dangerous chemicals which in lab tests on Earth were shown to be more lethal to bacteria than the perchlorates alone.\nFrom \u0026ldquo;Perchlorate-specific proteomic stress responses of Debaryomyces hansenii could enable microbial survival in Martian brines\u0026rdquo;, Jacob Heinz, Joerg Doellinger, Deborah Maus, Andy Schneider, Peter Lasch, Hans-Peter Grossart, Dirk Schulze-Makuch\nDust # Martian dust itself is likely carcirogenic, because it\u0026rsquo;s fine and reactive, two key traits of dusts that cause asbestosis (see quotes below), and toxic, as it contains very high levels of perchlorates that are toxic to humans and to the majority of plants and bacteria (see section on soil)\nFrom Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_soil\nThe potential danger to human health of the fine Martian dust has long been recognized by NASA. A 2002 study warned about the potential threat, and a study was carried out using the most common silicates found on Mars: olivine, pyroxene and feldspar. It found that the dust reacted with small amounts of water to produce highly reactive molecules that are also produced during the mining of quartz and known to produce lung disease in miners on Earth, including cancer.\nDust storms # https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA25361:\nThis series of images from a navigation camera aboard NASA\u0026rsquo;s Perseverance rover shows a gust of wind sweeping dust across the Martian plain beyond the rover\u0026rsquo;s tracks on June 18, 2021 (the 117th sol, or Martian day, of the mission). The dust cloud in this GIF was estimated to be about 1.5 square miles (4 square kilometers) in size; it was the first such Martian wind-lifted dust cloud of this scale ever captured in images. This image has been enhanced in order to show maximal detail, with some color distortion. (my note: probably contrast, as the sky is too white to be correct).\nFrom Wikipedia again:\nHowever, under current Martian conditions, the mass movements involved are generally much smaller than on Earth. Even the 2001 global dust storms on Mars moved only the equivalent of a very thin dust layer \u0026ndash; about 3 µm thick if deposited with uniform thickness between 58° north and south of the equator. Dust deposition at the two rover sites has proceeded at a rate of about the thickness of a grain every 100 sols.\nReference: https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0603656.pdf ( backup )\nDust storms are violent but not as much as on Earth. They tend to occurr when it\u0026rsquo;s summer in the southern hemisphere, due to the closeness of the planet to the Sun (Mar\u0026rsquo;s orbit is way more eccentric than Earth\u0026rsquo;s) which triggers much stonger temperature swings on the surface and therefore larger atmospheric movements.\nMars\u0026rsquo; dust storms don\u0026rsquo;t reach the strenght of a terrestrial hurricane. The air pressure at surface level is just a hundredth of Earth\u0026rsquo;s and the wind speeds are just half of what would be considered hurricane wind on Earth.\nDust devil, Curiosity: https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24039\nNASA\u0026rsquo;s Curiosity Mars rover spotted this dust devil with one of its Navigation Cameras around 11:35 a.m. local Mars time on Aug. 9, 2020 (the 2,847th Martian day, or sol, of the mission). The frames in this GIF were shot over 4 minutes and 15 seconds. Taken from the \u0026ldquo;Mary Anning\u0026rdquo; drill site, this dust devil appears to be passing through small hills just above Curiosity\u0026rsquo;s present location on Mount Sharp. The dust devil is approximately one-third to a half-mile (half-a-kilometer to a kilometer) away and estimated to be about 16 feet (5 meters) wide. The dust plume disappears past the top of the frame, so an exact height can\u0026rsquo;t be known, but it\u0026rsquo;s estimated to be at least 164 feet (50 meters) tall. Contrast has been modified to make frame-to-frame changes easier to see.\nhttps://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC/Mars_dust_storm\nThe high resolution stereo camera on board ESA\u0026rsquo;s Mars Express captured this impressive upwelling front of dust clouds \u0026ndash; visible in the right half of the frame \u0026ndash; near the north polar ice cap of Mars in April this year (2018).\nIt was one of several local small-scale dust storms that have been observed in recent months at the Red Planet, which is currently enduring a particularly intense dust storm season. A much larger storm emerged further southwest at the end of May and developed into a global, planet-encircling dust storm within several weeks.\nDust storms on Mars occur regularly during the southern summer season when the planet is closer to the Sun along its elliptical orbit. The enhanced solar illumination causes stronger temperature contrasts, with the resulting air movements more readily lifting dust particles from the surface \u0026ndash; some of which measure up to about 0.01 mm in size.\nMartian dust storms are very impressive, both visually like in this image and in terms of the intensity and duration of the rarer global events, but they are generally weaker compared to hurricanes on Earth. Mars has a much lower atmospheric pressure \u0026ndash; less than one hundredth of Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmospheric pressure at the surface \u0026ndash; and martian storms have less than half the typical wind speeds of hurricanes on Earth.\nThis colour image was created using data from the nadir channel, the field of view of which is aligned perpendicular to the surface of Mars, and the colour channels of the high-resolution stereo camera. The ground resolution is approximately 16 m/pixel and the images are centred at about 78°N/106°E.\nAtmosphere # Fixed-wing flight # https://www.x-plane.com/adventures/mars.html\nhttps://marsairplane.larc.nasa.gov/\nSound # Sound on Mars propagates little due to the low air density and the fact that the atmosphere is mostly made of CO2. Outdoors is difficult to hear even sounds made by objects relatively close by.\nOn top of this, longer (lower frequency, low pitch) soundwaves arrive \u0026ldquo;ahead\u0026rdquo; of shorter, higher piched sounds, giving all sounds a sort of \u0026ldquo;underwater\u0026rdquo; roundness. The audio of the fall of a meteorite ( https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-insight-hears-its-first-meteoroid-impacts-on-mars, backup ) shows how the sound of the fall sounds far more like a rock falling in water than the sharp, \u0026ldquo;dry\u0026rdquo; explosion that would be heard on Earth.\nOther audio snippets: https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/audio/\nOne interesting example is the sound of Ingenuity flying on Mars: https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25893 ( backup )\nSky color # The variability of the sky\u0026rsquo;s color is huge and seems to span from yellow-brown (horizon, midday), grayish (high to the zenith), pink-red (earlier and later in the day), violet (in presence of water-ice clouds) to white/blueish (sunset/sunrise). It also heavily varies in luminosity depending on the dust load.\nOn top of it, it\u0026rsquo;s always hard to understand how image colors are calibrated, so some may be quite off.\nWikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_on_Mars:\nIt is now known that during the Martian day, the sky can vary from a pinkish-red to a yellow-brown “butterscotch” color. Around sunset and sunrise, the sky is rose in color, but in the vicinity of the setting Sun it is blue. This is the opposite of the situation on Earth. Twilight lasts a long time after the Sun has set and before it rises because of the dust high in Mars\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01546 https://web.archive.org/web/20040810170442/ http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/sky.html\nThe true color of Mars based upon three filters with the sky set to aluminance of 60.

It does not seem dark or night-like. Human eyes can easily adapt to differences in brightness up to a few orders of magnitude: 99% looks probably like a storm, but brighter than indoors lightning conditions.\nhttps://mars.nasa.gov/resources/21916/shades-of-martian-darkness/\nThis series of images shows simulated views of a darkening Martian sky blotting out the Sun from NASA\u0026rsquo;s Opportunity rover\u0026rsquo;s point of view, with the right side simulating Opportunity\u0026rsquo;s current view in the global dust storm (June 2018). The left starts with a blindingly bright mid-afternoon sky, with the sun appearing bigger because of brightness. The right shows the Sun so obscured by dust it looks like a pinprick. Each frame corresponds to a tau value, or measure of opacity: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.\nNote: I only found images from rovers measuring tau values up to about 5. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether the atmosphere ever goes to tau levels higher than that, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t do much research yet (not even on the mentioned June 2018 global dust storm).\nSunset, Mars Pathfinder (June 1999)\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01547\nThe brownish gray sky as it would be seen by an observer on Mars in this four-frame, true color mosaic taken on sol 24 (at approximately 1610 LST).

Note: a calibrated output device is required accurately reproduce the correct colors.\nSunset, Spirit (May 2005)\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_347.html\nOn May 19, 2005, NASA\u0026rsquo;s Mars Exploration Rover Spirit captured this stunning view as the Sun sank below the rim of Gusev crater on Mars. This Panoramic Camera mosaic was taken around 6:07 in the evening of the rover\u0026rsquo;s 489th Martian day, or sol.\nSunset and twilight images are occasionally acquired by the science team to determine how high into the atmosphere the Martian dust extends, and to look for dust or ice clouds. Other images have shown that the twilight glow remains visible, but increasingly fainter, for up to two hours before sunrise or after sunset. The long Martian twilight (compared to Earth\u0026rsquo;s) is caused by sunlight scattered around to the night side of the planet by abundant high altitude dust. Similar long twilights or extra-colorful sunrises and sunsets sometimes occur on Earth when tiny dust grains that are erupted from powerful volcanoes scatter light high in the atmosphere.\nSunset, Curiosity (April 2015)\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19400\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19401\nNASA\u0026rsquo;s Curiosity Mars rover recorded this view of the sun setting at the close of the mission\u0026rsquo;s 956th Martian day, or sol (April 15, 2015), from the rover\u0026rsquo;s location in Gale Crater.\nThis was the first sunset observed in color by Curiosity. The image comes from the left-eye camera of the rover\u0026rsquo;s Mast Camera (Mastcam). The color has been calibrated and white-balanced to remove camera artifacts. Mastcam sees color very similarly to what human eyes see, although it is actually a little less sensitive to blue than people are.\nDust in the Martian atmosphere has fine particles that permit blue light to penetrate the atmosphere more efficiently than longer-wavelength colors. That causes the blue colors in the mixed light coming from the sun to stay closer to sun\u0026rsquo;s part of the sky, compared to the wider scattering of yellow and red colors. The effect is most pronounced near sunset, when light from the sun passes through a longer path in the atmosphere than it does at mid-day.\nHere an example of grey zenith sky, from inSight (4.5024°N 135.6234°E, Elysium Planitia). Source: Color_Properties_at_the_Mars_InSight_Landing_Site.pdf which also contains the entire analysis of sky and soil chromaticity (color properties) at the landing site.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00915\nThese clouds from Sol 15 have a new look. As water ice clouds cover the sky, the sky takes on a more bluish cast. This is because small particles (perhaps a tenth the size of the martian dust, or one-thousandth the thickness of a human hair) are bright in blue light, but almost invisible in red light. Thus, scientists expect that the ice particles in the clouds are very small. The clouds were imaged by the Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP).\nMars Pathfinder is the second in NASA\u0026rsquo;s Discovery program of low-cost spacecraft with highly focused science goals. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, developed and manages the Mars Pathfinder mission for NASA\u0026rsquo;s Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C. JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) was developed by the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory under contract to JPL. Peter Smith is the Principal Investigator.\nPhotojournal note: Sojourner spent 83 days of a planned seven-day mission exploring the Martian terrain, acquiring images, and taking chemical, atmospheric and other measurements. The final data transmission received from Pathfinder was at 10:23 UTC on September 27, 1997. Although mission managers tried to restore full communications during the following five months, the successful mission was terminated on March 10, 1998.\nAtmospheric water # Average atmospheric pressure on Mars seems to be about 0.6kPa, which is precisely where the triple point of water lays. There is therefore an extremely slim possibility of liquid water on the surface at 0°C, but most often water is frozen.\nThe average surface temperature of Mars is -64°C, but variations are strong. At the equator, temperatures can go well above 0°C, in which case, ice sublimates.\nMartian surface temperatures vary from lows of about -110 °C to highs of up to 35 °C in equatorial summer.\nWikipedia, from https://web.archive.org/web/20131102112312/http://marsrover.nasa.gov/spotlight/20070612.html\nPhase diagram of water, for reference:\nFog # Fog forms regularly on Mars in some locations. However, what are these conditions, and how dense, opaque, stable it is?\nSnow \u0026amp; frost # Snow is possible, but it normally does not reach the surface due to rapid sublimation mid-flight.\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080929.html:\nNASA\u0026rsquo;s Phoenix Mars Lander has detected snow falling from Martian clouds. [\u0026hellip;] A laser instrument designed to gather knowledge of how the atmosphere and surface interact on Mars has detected snow from clouds about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) above the spacecraft\u0026rsquo;s landing site. Data show the snow vaporizing before reaching the ground.\nIn temperate and polar regions, Viking missions found snow and frost made of water and carbon dioxide.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00571\nThis high-resolution color photo of the surface of Mars was taken by Viking Lander 2 at its Utopia Planitia landing site on May 18, 1979, and relayed to Earth by Orbiter 1 on June 7. It shows a thin coating of water ice on the rocks and soil. The time the frost appeared corresponds almost exactly with the buildup of frost one Martian year (23 Earth months) ago. Then it remained on the surface for about 100 days. Scientists believe dust particles in the atmosphere pick up bits of solid water. That combination is not heavy enough to settle to the ground. But carbon dioxide, which makes up 95 percent of the Martian atmosphere, freezes and adheres to the particles and they become heavy enough to sink. Warmed by the Sun, the surface evaporates the carbon dioxide and returns it to the atmosphere, leaving behind the water and dust. The ice seen in this picture, like that which formed one Martian year ago, is extremely thin, perhaps no more than one-thousandth of an inch thick.\nClouds # There are several pictures of clouds on Mars. The catch is their thickness, because Martian clouds tend to be extremely fine and really hard to see.\nThese clouds were captured as part of a follow-on imaging campaign to study noctilucent, or \u0026ldquo;night-shining\u0026rdquo; clouds, which started in 2021. While most Martian clouds hover no more than 37 miles (60 kilometers) above the ground and are composed of water ice, these clouds appear to be higher in elevation, where it\u0026rsquo;s very cold. That suggests these clouds are made of carbon dioxide, or dry ice.\nFor reference, most commonly seen terrestrial clouds like cumulus form at only 2km from the surface and even cirrus, which are the highest we normally see, form around 3km up at the poles and up to 18km high at the equator, so not even a third of the average Martian cloud.\nThe closest we have on Earth to these high altitude clouds are Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs) which form in the polar stratosphere at about 15-25km, and noctilucent clouds, which form in the mesosphere at around 80-85km. There are still well visible from the surface and look like cirri.\nhttps://www.space.com/2812-mars-clouds-higher-earth.html\nIf you wanted to see these clouds from the surface of Mars, you would probably have to wait until after sunset\u0026quot; says Franck Montmessin, a French researcher who works with the camera team. This is because the clouds are very faint and can only be seen reflecting sunlight against the darkness of the night sky. In that respect, they look similar to the mesospheric clouds, also known as noctilucent clouds on Earth, which occur about 50 miles (80 kilometers) above our planet.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24622\nNASA\u0026rsquo;s Curiosity Mars rover captured these clouds just after sunset on March 19, 2021, the 3,063rd Martian day, or sol, of the rover\u0026rsquo;s mission. The image is made up of 21 individual images stitched together and color corrected so that the scene appears as it would to the human eye. The clouds are drifting over \u0026ldquo;Mont Mercou,\u0026rdquo; a cliff face that Curiosity has been studying.\nSky is visibly too white, so I doubt this is how they would be seen at the naked eye. They are probably contrast enhanced, but the caption does not mention.\nIridescent clouds\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24662\nNASA\u0026rsquo;s Curiosity Mars rover spotted these iridescent, or \u0026ldquo;mother of pearl\u0026rdquo;, clouds on March 5, 2021, the 3,048th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. Seen here are five images stitched together from a much wider panorama taken by the rover\u0026rsquo;s Mast Camera, or Mastcam. The full panorama (Figure 1) was stitched together from 23 images.\nAgain, sky is visibly too white.\nDrifting Clouds Over Mars\u0026rsquo; Mount Sharp, Curiosity.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24661\nThis GIF shows clouds drifting over Mount Sharp on Mars, as viewed by NASA\u0026rsquo;s Curiosity rover on March 19, 2021, the 3,063rd Martian day, or sol, of the mission.

These noctilucent, or twilight clouds, are made of water ice; ice crystals reflect the setting sun, allowing the detail in each cloud to be seen more easily.\nSunset sun rays, Curiosity (March 2023)\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA25739\nNASA\u0026rsquo;s Curiosity Mars rover captured these \u0026ldquo;sun rays\u0026rdquo; shining through clouds at sunset on Feb. 2, 2023, the 3,730th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. It was the first time that sun rays, also known as crepuscular rays, have been viewed so clearly on Mars. Crepuscular is taken from the Latin word for \u0026ldquo;twilight\u0026rdquo;, as these rays appear near sunset or sunrise.\nThese clouds were captured as part of a follow-on imaging campaign to study noctilucent, or \u0026quot;night-shining\u0026quot; clouds, which started in 2021. While most Martian clouds hover no more than 37 miles (60 kilometers) above the ground and are composed of water ice, these clouds appear to be higher in elevation, where it\u0026rsquo;s very cold.

The images have been processed to emphasize the highlights.\nInSight, end of mission\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA25680\nThis is one of the last images ever taken by NASA\u0026rsquo;s InSight Mars lander. Captured on Dec. 11, 2022, the 1,436th Martian day, or sol, of the mission, it shows InSight\u0026rsquo;s seismometer on the Red Planet\u0026rsquo;s surface.\nNote the patchy clouds on the background, a pattern spotted also in other situations in the polar regions in the dust storms season. This gives a much better idea of \u0026ldquo;how the sky normally looks\u0026rdquo; from the ground vs from orbit, and it\u0026rsquo;s a nice example of an image which might not be too accurate, but it\u0026rsquo;s also not enhanced on purpose to show the clouds (to my knowledge at least).\nhttps://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express/Martian_dust_storms_churn_up_Earth-like_clouds ( backup) source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103522002846 ( backup )\nMartian morning water ice clouds above Valles Marineris seen by Viking Orbiter 1 (1976)\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17940\nNo NASA Mars orbiter has been in a position to observe morning daylight on Mars since the twin Viking orbiters of the 1970s. This image, taken by Viking Orbiter 1 on Aug. 17, 1976, shows water-ice clouds in the Valles Marineris area of equatorial Mars during local morning time. North is to the upper right, and the scene is about 600 miles (about 1,000 kilometers) across.\nNoctis Labyrinthus, morning fog (2001) (North is top-right)\nhttps://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express/Mars_Express_keeps_an_eye_on_curious_cloud\nAs the sun rises over Noctis Labyrinthus (the labyrinth of the night), bright clouds of water ice can be observed in and around the tributary canyons of this high plateau region of Mars. This color composite image, reconstructed through violet, green, and orange filters, vividly shows the distribution of clouds against the rust colored background of this Martian desert.\nThe picture was reconstructed by JPL\u0026rsquo;s Image Processing Laboratory using in-flight calibration data to correct the color balance.\nScientists have puzzled why the clouds cling to the canyon areas and, only in certain areas, spill over onto the plateau surface. One possibility is that water which condensed during the previous afternoon in shaded eastern facing slopes of the canyon floor is vaporized as the early morning sun falls on those same slopes. The area covered is about 10,000 square kilometers (4000 square miles), centered at 9 degrees South, 95 degrees West, and the large partial crater at lower right is Oudemans. The picture was taken on Viking Orbiter 1\u0026rsquo;s 40th orbit.\nMore on mesospheric clouds can be found in Kleinböhl, A., \u0026ldquo;Clouds in the Middle Atmosphere of Mars\u0026rdquo;, in Reimuller, J. D. (ed.), Project PoSSUM \u0026ndash; Polar Suborbital Science in the Upper Mesosphere, Integrated Spaceflight. ã 2017. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Fxmt85hPuFjR0GPohiMupl_Ekpp_Gdx/view, backup )\nHere some interesting paragraphs.\nClouds in the martian atmosphere can be made of water ice or carbon dioxide ice. The latter do not have an equivalent on Earth as temperatures are never low enough for carbon dioxide to freeze. In addition, carbon dioxide is the main constituent of the martian atmosphere so freezing it out (either due to cloud formation or direct deposition to the surface at the winter poles) has a profound impact on the atmospheric pressure cycle and leads to significant pressure variations over the seasons.\nWater ice clouds are omnipresent on Mars. Temperatures are typically suitable for the formation of ice clouds and cloud formation mainly depends on the availability of water vapor. On Earth the tropopause provides an effective cold trap for water vapor, leading to very dry conditions in the stratosphere and mesosphere. On Mars the smaller lapse rate in the atmosphere does not provide an effective cold trap for water vapor, and water ice clouds can form in the lower atmosphere as well as in the middle atmosphere.\nThe most prominent cloud feature in the lower atmosphere is the aphelion cloud belt, which was already observed from Earth-based measurements. It is a band of clouds that appears in the equatorial region in the northern spring and summer season. Its typical extend is from about 10°S to 30°N in latitude and the clouds reach up to altitudes of roughly 40 km. The aphelion cloud belt is fed by water vapor coming off the north polar cap in spring and summer. The cooler global temperatures during the aphelion season cause clouds to form in the equatorial region. As the perihelion season approaches, the aphelion cloud belt starts to dissipate due to the rising global temperatures. This corresponds to northern fall. Temperatures drop in the northern high latitudes, causing condensation of water vapor in the lower atmosphere of the polar region that leads to the formation of the northern polar hood cloud.\nWith an extent from the north pole down to 50°N latitude it covers not only the polar region but reaches well into the mid-latitudes. It starts forming in late northern summer around Ls=160° and dissipates again in early northern spring around Ls=20°. The southern polar region also develops a polar hood cloud in southern fall and winter. However, the southern polar water ice clouds are not nearly as dense or as extended as their counterpart in the north. They are present between about Ls=20° and Ls=180°, with a notable gap in occurrence between Ls=70° and Ls=110°.\nLike the northern polar hood, also the southern polar hood is constrained to the lower atmosphere. However, in contrast to the north, the southern polar hood cloud is shaped like an annulus, mostly covering the latitudes between 60°S and 80°S. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe most prominent feature of Figure 2 is a cloud in the equatorial region.\nThis is not during the season of the aphelion cloud belt. However, a temperature minimum at 30-50 km altitude between about 10°S and 40°N causes water vapor to condense and form a cloud. In addition, temperature minima at higher altitudes to the south (40°S-10°S) and to the north (40°N-60°N) lead to cloud formation. Water ice clouds in these regions are found at altitudes of 60-70 km in the middle atmosphere. This shows that at least in this season, water vapor can penetrate high enough into the atmosphere to allow the formation of water ice clouds in the middle atmosphere.\n[\u0026hellip;] In the previous section it was shown that water ice clouds on Mars can reach mesospheric altitudes. This happens predominantly in the perihelion season (Ls=180°-360°) when the atmosphere is dustier and lower atmospheric temperatures are higher, allowing the transport of water vapor to higher altitudes of the atmosphere.\nHowever, parts of the martian atmosphere can become cold enough to allow carbon dioxide to condense, leading to the formation of CO2 ice clouds. A feature that makes this process particularly intriguing is that CO2 is the main constituent of the martian atmosphere. In the lower atmosphere of the polar regions, temperatures in winter regularly drop to values at which CO2 condenses. The condensation of CO2 is the main driver of the seasonally varying surface pressure on Mars. In Figure 2, temperatures drop below the frost point of CO2 ( 145 K at martian pressures in the lower atmosphere) in the center of the vortex close to the pole. Hence the conditions in these regions are favorable for the formation of lower atmospheric CO2 ice clouds. Due to the high abundance of CO2 in the martian atmosphere, these clouds are expected to grow to large particle sizes rather quickly, causing CO2 snowfall in the winter polar region. Observations of high clouds or detached aerosol layers in the aphelion season raised the question whether the martian mesosphere could also become cold enough to allow atmospheric CO2 to condense and form mesospheric clouds.\nObservations of high clouds or detached aerosol layers in the aphelion season raised the question whether the martian mesosphere could also become cold enough to allow atmospheric CO2 to condense and form mesospheric clouds. [\u0026hellip;] Since the 2000s, observations by instruments on several Mars orbiters including Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), Mars Express (MEx), Mars Odyssey (ODY), and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) have been providing a multitude of evidence of martian middle atmospheric CO2 clouds. [\u0026hellip;]\nOne of the main drivers of temperature variations in the martian atmosphere are atmospheric tides. Tides are periodic changes in atmospheric parameters like temperature, pressure, and wind that have periods of a fraction of a solar day. They are driven by the changes of solar energy input to the Mars surface and atmosphere over the course of a day. This is in contrast to ocean tides on Earth that are driven by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.\nDue to the thin atmosphere on Mars, most of the solar radiation reaches the surface, where it causes strong differences in temperature between day and night. Surface temperature maxima are typically reached at local noon or slightly later, while surface temperature minima are reached in the early morning. The heat flux from the surface causes changes in pressure and temperature in the lowermost atmosphere.\nThe propagation of these changes gives rise to global oscillations in atmospheric pressure and temperature, and subsequently also wind. The most prominent oscillation is the diurnal tide, which has a period of one solar day, meaning that for example temperature will exhibit one minimum as well as one maximum over the course of a day. While thermal tides also exist on Earth, their temperature perturbations typically start to become significant only at altitudes of the upper mesosphere and above. On Mars, thermal tides cause significant temperature variations throughout the atmosphere. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe right panels of Figure 7 show the occurrence of water ice clouds as observed by MCS, separated for day and night. Few water ice clouds are observed above 50 km altitude in this season. The only notable cloud occurrence in the upper middle atmosphere is observed at 60°-70°S around 70 km altitude, coincident with very low temperatures found in this region. Elsewhere water ice clouds mainly from in locations consistent with temperature minima driven by the diurnal tide. At nighttime, clouds tend to from close to the surface and around 40 km altitude in the equatorial region. At daytime the pattern reverses and clouds tend to form predominantly between 20 and 30 km altitude, where the equatorial daytime temperatures are lower than at night.\nThe formation of water ice clouds is very common at temperatures found in the martian atmosphere and limited largely by the availability of water vapor. During aphelion season, water vapor in the middle atmosphere is limited by the extensive cloud formation below 40-50 km such that water ice clouds at mesospheric altitudes are rare. During perihelion season (southern spring and summer) the warmer and dustier lower atmosphere allows water vapor to be transported to higher altitudes, enabling the frequent formation of water ice clouds. Small dust particles, advected together with water vapor to mesospheric altitudes, could serve as nuclei for cloud condensation.\nThe presence of clouds at altitudes of 50-70 km in perihelion season (Figure 2) indicates localized water vapor mixing ratios of tens of ppm, which would be about an order of magnitude higher than in Earth\u0026rsquo;s stratosphere and mesosphere.\nRecurrent clouds # Martian weather seems to be quite predictable.\nMars Orbiter Camera data beginning in March 1999 and covering 2.5 Martian years show that Martian weather tends to be more repeatable and hence more predictable than that of Earth. If an event occurs at a particular time of year in one year, the available data (sparse as it is) indicates that it is fairly likely to repeat the next year at nearly the same location, give or take a week.\nSome evident examples from the Tharsis region:\nSpiral cloud over Arsia Mons: https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia04294-repeated-clouds-over-arsia-mons https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia04294-repeated-clouds-over-arsia-mons\nSome parts of Mars experience weather phenomena that repeat each year at about the same time. In some regions, the repeated event may be a dust storm that appears every year, like clockwork, in such a way that we can only wish the weather were so predictable on Earth. One of the repeated weather phenomena occurs each year near the start of southern winter over Arsia Mons, which is located near 9 degrees south latitude, 121 degrees west longitude. Just before southern winter begins, sunlight warms the air on the slopes of the volcano. This air rises, bringing small amounts of dust with it. Eventually, the rising air converges over the volcano\u0026rsquo;s caldera, the large, circular depression at its summit. The fine sediment blown up from the volcano\u0026rsquo;s slopes coalesces into a spiraling cloud of dust that is thick enough to actually observe from orbit.\nThe spiral dust cloud over Arsia Mons repeats each year, but observations and computer calculations indicate it can only form during a short period of time each year. Similar spiral clouds have not been seen over the other large Tharsis volcanoes, but other types of clouds have been seen.\nThe spiral dust cloud over Arsia Mons can tower 15 to 30 kilometers (9 to 19 miles) above the volcano. The white and bluish areas in the images are thin clouds of water ice. In the 2005 case, more water ice was present than in the previous years at the time the pictures were obtained. For scale, the caldera of Arsia Mons is about 110 kilometers (68 miles) across, and the summit of the volcano stands about 10 kilometers (6 miles) above its surrounding plains.\nArsia Mons Elongated Cloud (or AMEC): https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express/Mars_Express_keeps_an_eye_on_curious_cloud https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express/Mars_Express_keeps_an_eye_on_curious_cloud\nIn spite of its location, this atmospheric feature is not linked to volcanic activity but is rather a water ice cloud driven by the influence of the volcano\u0026rsquo;s leeward slope on the air flow \u0026ndash; something that scientists call an orographic or lee cloud \u0026ndash; and a regular phenomenon in this region. The cloud can be seen in this view taken on 10 October by the Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) on Mars Express \u0026ndash; which has imaged it hundreds of times over the past few weeks \u0026ndash; as the white, elongated feature extending 1500 km westward of Arsia Mons. As a comparison, the cone-shaped volcano has a diameter of about 250 km [\u0026hellip;] Mars just experienced its northern hemisphere winter solstice on 16 October. In the months leading up to the solstice, most cloud activity disappears over big volcanoes like Arsia Mons; its summit is covered with clouds throughout the rest of the martian year. However, a seasonally recurrent water ice cloud, like the one shown in this image, is known to form along the southwest flank of this volcano \u0026ndash; it was previously observed by Mars Express and other missions in 2009, 2012 and 2015.\nThe cloud\u0026rsquo;s appearance varies throughout the martian day, growing in length during local morning downwind of the volcano, almost parallel to the equator, and reaching such an impressive size that could make it visible even to telescopes on Earth. The formation of water ice clouds is sensitive to the amount of dust present in the atmosphere. These images, obtained after the major dust storm that engulfed the entire planet in June and July, will provide important information on the effect of dust on the cloud development and on its variability throughout the year.\nThe elongated cloud hovering near Arsia Mons this year was also observed with the visible and near-infrared mapping spectrometer, OMEGA, and the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on Mars Express, providing scientists with a variety of different data to study this phenomenon.\nPotential colonies # https://www.universetoday.com/163545/a-comprehensive-blueprint-for-mars-settlement-1/ Calculations # Circumnavigation of Mars # Assuming the Earthly speed of a glider to be around 200km/h, how long would it take at this speed to circumnavigate Mars?\n6600km * 6.28 / 200km/h / 24h = 8.6 days\nHowever there are tons of issues using the Earthly speed of a glider as a reference for reasonable gliding speeds on Mars.

A spheroid has circular symmetry.\nIf the ellipse is rotated about its major axis, the result is a prolate spheroid, elongated like a rugby ball.\nIf the ellipse is rotated about its minor axis, the result is an oblate spheroid, flattened like a lentil or a plain M\u0026amp;M.\nIf the generating ellipse is a circle, the result is a sphere.\nDue to the combined effects of gravity and rotation, planets are not quite in the shape of a sphere, but instead is slightly flattened in the direction of their axis of rotation.\nQuadrangles # TDB\nDistance of the horizon # Distance to the true horizon from an observer close to the planet\u0026rsquo;s surface is about \\(d \\simeq \\sqrt{2 h R}\\) where h is height above sea level and R is the radius.

It is sure a clear hint that being an astronaut wasn\u0026rsquo;t in fact such a glamourous experience, especially during mission that lasted several weeks or months.\nUpon reading it a few times around the time of Ryumin\u0026rsquo;s death in 2022, I got curious about the context surrounding it. When was it said, or written? Did any serious incident occur during that mission? Did anything close to murder ever happen in space?!\nTime to find out.\nFinding the source # One of the most obvious issues with my hunt became soon obvious: no source for the quote is ever reported, and two main, slightly different translations seem to exist:\nAll the necessary conditions to perpetrate a murder are met by locking two men in a cabin of 18 by 20 feet . . . for two months\nas in this New Scientist article from 1993 (interestingly, texts quoting this version often retain the distinctive dots), or:\nAll the conditions for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring eighteen feet by twenty and leave them together for two months.\nas in this article on the psycological effects of space flight from 2018. Each can be found in other places with slight variations, but they mostly boil down to these two versions. That may mean that, in all likelihood, more than one translation of the original Russian is available.\nBut where is the original and its translations?\nThe only clues that we find by scavenging around is that the original line comes from Valery\u0026rsquo;s personal diary, written in 1980 during the Salyut 6 mission (spoiler: no murder occurred on Salyut 6). However, finding this diary isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be easy. Sure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that nobody out there looks interested in the slightest about reporting the source correctly.\nIn a strange exception, Wikipedia seems oblivious of this issue as well. Ryumin\u0026rsquo;s page in any language I can skim-read (en, ru, es, it, pt, hu) doesn\u0026rsquo;t report the quote, except from the French one, where again it\u0026rsquo;s conveniently sourceless. The French quote is interesting, and I wish I found it earlier, because after realizing that most translation pages were a translated copy-paste of the English one I stopped looking for clues there. All we\u0026rsquo;ve got from this initial search is a line in the ISS page, under the \u0026ldquo;Stress\u0026rdquo; chapter, again sourceless.\nIn one depressingly hilariours run, I started from this not really authoritative blog post because, unlike more estabilished sources, this one did say where the quote was taken: it was a second-hand quote from “Rocket Men: The Epic History of the First Men on the Moon” by Craig Nelson.\nCool, where did Craig get this line from? Checking out the book leads to yet another copy-paste of the same identical line, not one word of context added, and a reference to another source: \u0026ldquo;This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age\u0026rdquo; by William E. Burrows, Random House, 1998, pg 513. Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s check out this one too! Well it turns out, also this book quotes from yet another, more obscure source.\n\u0026ldquo;Ryumin on murder: Reviews and Previews, Air \u0026amp; Space, June-July 1997, p. 84.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Air \u0026amp; Space\u0026rdquo; is a periodical by the Smithsonian. So\u0026hellip; an interview? Odd, given that many sources seem to imply it comes from a diary. But there are two version of this quote, after all. Are we onto something?\nThe all-knowing, forever-blessed Internet Archive turns out to have a copy of this exact issue of the magazine, so I can check this out as well and look for what I hope to be the original source. And you won\u0026rsquo;t believe where the quote actually comes from.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s from a freaking review of another book. Is this really a valid source for anything, Mr Burrows?!\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s keep going. We still have a lead: the quote comes from the review of \u0026ldquo;Bold Endeavors: Lessons from Polar and Space Exploration\u0026rdquo; by Jack Stuster. Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s get this one too and look further\u0026hellip;\nUnfortunately Jack also didn\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the quality of its sources. In the reference section, all we get is the following:\n\u0026ldquo;Ryumin, V. 1980. 175 days in space: A Russian cosmonaut\u0026rsquo;s private diary, edited and translated by H. Gris. Unpublished manuscript.\u0026rdquo;\nI repeat. Unpublished manuscript.\nYes, that\u0026rsquo;s where the trail ends. Henry Gris doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist on the Internet except from another document citing his same unpublished work. He never published his translation of the diary of Ryumin. Game over.\nThis diary must be somewhere # After a few runs like the above (although most of them shorter, often ending up to \u0026ldquo;Bold Endeavors\u0026rdquo;), I decided it was time to change tactics. Alright, at least one version has to come from this unpublished translation of Ryumin\u0026rsquo;s diary. But can we find any published edition of this diary?\nLooking for \u0026ldquo;175 days in space: A Russian cosmonaut\u0026rsquo;s private diary\u0026rdquo; gets no hits. Relaxing the query starts to return hits about \u0026ldquo;Diary of a Cosmonaut: 211 Days in Space\u0026rdquo;, the diary of his colleague Valentin Lebedev (Валентин Витальевич Лебедев), which unlike his, was published in Russian and English. Looking for stuff like \u0026ldquo;Ryumin\u0026rsquo;s diary\u0026rdquo; on Google and other search engines returns no leads except from more frustrating copy-paste of the same exact line.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s turn to Russian.\n\u0026ldquo;Рюмин дневник\u0026rdquo; (roughly \u0026ldquo;Ryumin\u0026rsquo;s diary\u0026rdquo;) finally returns a helpful hit: \u0026ldquo;Год вне Земли: Дневник космонавта\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;A Year Outside the Earth: the Diary of a Cosmonaut\u0026rdquo;), which seems to be somewhat available online, although in Russian only.\nAnd there finally, below a nicely hand-drawn page not even deep into the book, \u0026ldquo;убийств\u0026rdquo; (root for \u0026ldquo;murder\u0026rdquo;) matches a line.\n25 февраля 1979 года [\u0026hellip;] На Земле немногие тогда себе представляли, возможно ли так долго быть вдвоем. Вот в рассказе американского писателя О. Генри «Справочник Гименея» есть такая просто трагическая фраза: «Если вы хотите поощрить ремесло человекоубийства, заприте на месяц двух человек в хижине восемнадцать на двадцать футов. Человеческая натура этого не выдержит». И написано это всего-навсего 70 лет назад. Всерьез такое обвинение человеческой натуре, естественно, принимать сейчас смешно. Однако длительное пребывание с глазу на глаз, даже с самым приятным тебе человеком, само по себе — испытание.\n25th of February, 1979 [\u0026hellip;] Back then, few people on Earth asked themselves whether it was possible to be alone together for so long. In a story by the American writer O. Henry “Hymen\u0026rsquo;s Handbook” there is this simply tragic phrase: “If you want to encourage the craft of manslaughter, lock two people in a cabin eighteen by twenty feet for a month. Human nature can\u0026rsquo;t stand it.\u0026quot; And this was written only 70 years ago. Naturally, it is ridiculous to take such an accusation of human nature seriously now. However a prolonged stay face to face, even with the person you like the most, is in itself an ordeal.\n(original translation).\nSo here is the actual source! Quite different from the quotes that circulate, but well, Henry Gris must have been creative in his unpublished translation. Also, it appears that it was written in early 1979, not in 1980 as it\u0026rsquo;s often claimed: but it\u0026rsquo;s an easy mistake to make, given that Ryumin flew a second time to Salyut 6 in 1980 and stayed on the station for even longer, breaking his own record.\nInterestingly the line was written at the very start of the mission, on the first day logged in the diary. So it is not the product of existing conflict, but rather the anticipation of it. A difference that has strong implications for a line that is usually associated with the effects of long-term residencies in space.\nAnother difference between this version and the popular one is that Ryumin mentions one month only, not two. Why did all the translations double the number of months? I have no clue, but my best guess could be that this is the effect of a very sloppy translation. In the original, \u0026ldquo;month\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;месяц\u0026rdquo;) and a declined form of \u0026ldquo;two\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;двух\u0026rdquo;) appear close to each other, immediately followed by \u0026ldquo;person\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;человек\u0026rdquo;). But no one that speaks a crumble of Russian would think that \u0026ldquo;two\u0026rdquo; refers to \u0026ldquo;month\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo; (singular in the original Russian for reasons). I get it, some declination rules in Russian are super confusing, but in my humble opinion there\u0026rsquo;s really only one way you could read the quote above, and anything else is a stretch. After all the people involved are obviously two, and the number is written just once.\nAnyway, we\u0026rsquo;re done! Time to celebrate?\nWait a second\u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s read it in context again.\nIs Ryumin himself quoting someone else!?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s one more layer to this # Luckily, Ryumin doesn\u0026rsquo;t quote unpublished manuscripts. Searching for O. Henry “Hymen\u0026rsquo;s Handbook” quickly brings us to another blessing of the Internet, Project Gutemberg. Here we discover that \u0026ldquo;The Handbook of Hymen\u0026rdquo; is the title of the fourth entry in the collection of short stories \u0026ldquo;Heart of the West\u0026rdquo;, by William Sydney Porter, pen name \u0026ldquo;O. Henry\u0026rdquo;. It seems like O. Henry was a rather famous author in Russia at the time, mainly thanks to some high quality translations of his works like the ones compiled by Y. Zamyatin.\n\u0026ldquo;The Handbook of Hymen\u0026rdquo; is a story about two friends, Sanderson Pratt and Idaho Green, that get snowed in a cabin while prospecting for gold in the Bitter Root Mountains. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s an American tale from one of the mid nineteenth century\u0026rsquo;s gold rushes. Nothing to do with space.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go find this line once more.\n(Here I report the source with abundant context: you can read the full short story on Project Gutemberg).\nThat evening it began to snow, with the wind strong in the east. Me and Idaho moved camp into an old empty cabin higher up the mountain, thinking it was only a November flurry. But after falling three foot on a level it went to work in earnest; and we knew we was snowed in. We got in plenty of firewood before it got deep, and we had grub enough for two months, so we let the elements rage and cut up all they thought proper. If you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in a eighteen by twenty-foot cabin for a month. Human nature won’t stand it. When the first snowflakes fell me and Idaho Green laughed at each other’s jokes and praised the stuff we turned out of a skillet and called bread. At the end of three weeks Idaho makes this kind of a edict to me. Says he: “I never exactly heard sour milk dropping out of a balloon on the bottom of a tin pan, but I have an idea it would be music of the spears compared to this attenuated stream of asphyxiated thought that emanates out of your organs of conversation. The kind of half-masticated noises that you emit every day puts me in mind of a cow’s cud, only she’s lady enough to keep hers to herself, and you ain’t.” “Mr. Green,” says I, “you having been a friend of mine once, I have some hesitations in confessing to you that if I had my choice for society between you and a common yellow, three-legged cur pup, one of the inmates of this here cabin would be wagging a tail just at present.” This way we goes on for two or three days, and then we quits speaking to one another.\nNo more references to any other work? Seems like not: William Sydney Porter is the final, indiscussed author of this troubled line.\nThe whole arc of the two men locked up in the same cabin is not a lot more than a plot device in the original story, an excuse to make the two men read two different books and \u0026ldquo;apply their learnings\u0026rdquo; on the courting of a girl from a nearby village. But the line must have struck a chord with Ryumin, and it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to see why.\nSome unexpected French # To their credit, French Wikipedia does quote Ryumin with enough context to figure out that the source of the fateful line is actually Porter. Unfortunately checking Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s entry for Ryumin in French didn\u0026rsquo;t cross my mind until I sit down to write this post. On top of it, the quote is not only lacking references, but is also very creative:\nO. Henry, le célèbre humoriste américain, explique dans une de ses nouvelles que le meilleur moyen d’encourager l’art de l’assassinat consiste à enfermer deux hommes pour deux mois dans un local de cinq mètres sur six. En pénétrant dans Saliout qui allait être notre maison pendant six mois, nous nous sommes dit : « nous sommes comme des frères : je suis toi et tu es moi. »\nO. Henry, the famous American comedian, explains in one of its stories that the best way to encourage the art of murder consists of locking two man for two months in a room of five meters by six. Boarding the Salyut, which was going to be our home for six months, we said to each other: \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re like brothers: I\u0026rsquo;m you and you\u0026rsquo;re me\u0026rdquo;.\n(original translation). Don\u0026rsquo;t ask me where any of this comes from. It\u0026rsquo;s so far removed from the actual paragraph of Ryumin\u0026rsquo;s diary cited above that I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if any published translation of the diary has ever been available in French, or whether there is another version of the Russian original, or whether this is from an interview to Ryumin and has nothing to do with the diary\u0026hellip; I wish there was any way to know.\nOn a cursory look for French sources I found an even stranger version of the base quote:\nToutes les conditions nécessaires pour commettre un meurtre sont réunies dès lors que sont enfermés deux hommes dans une cabine de cinq mètres sur six, et qu\u0026rsquo;on les laisse vivre ensemble pendant dix mois.\nAll the necessary conditions to commit a murder are met once two men are locked in a cabin of five meters by six and are left to live together for ten months.\n(original translation). So it\u0026rsquo;s ten months now? Is this a misreading of \u0026ldquo;deux\u0026rdquo; (two) to \u0026ldquo;dix\u0026rdquo; (ten)? I believe no French person could make this mistake. Anyway, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to go into this whole new rabbit hole. Maybe another time.\nHonorable mention # A slight exception to this state of affairs can be found in this other obscure blog post about a TV series, but it adds a lot of \u0026ldquo;supposedly\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;apparently\u0026rdquo; to the right lead, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t inspire a lot of confidence. It also mentions two months instead of one another hint that they found it in the same mysterious English translation I haven\u0026rsquo;t managed to pinpoint. I wish I could ask the author where did they read it.\nAn unexpected conclusion # At the end of the day, this adventure could be seen as a cautionary tale for taking good care of what sources you cite. But there\u0026rsquo;s also another unexpected turn of events: as the original quote was in English, none of the many-steps-removed quotes is actually correct. The right one is the version no one reports, because no one knows it\u0026rsquo;s the original:\nIf you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in a eighteen by twenty-foot cabin for a month.\nAnd note: a single month is enough, no need to wait for two.\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/site/bookshelf/","title":"Bookshelf","section":"Homepage","content":" Bookshelf # Collection of books, movies and short stories I\u0026rsquo;ve come across, in no particular order.\nTo read # \u0026ldquo;Permutation City\u0026rdquo;, by Greg Egan \u0026ldquo;Diaspora\u0026rdquo;, by Greg Egan \u0026ldquo;Podkayne of Mars\u0026rdquo;, by Robert A.

Little was known about it before due to its size and distance making any sort of telescope-based observation very difficult.\nCartography # Dawn\u0026rsquo;s Map of Ceres # Due to the small size and distance of Ceres, the best maps available come from the data returned by the Dawn mission.\nCaption Often, the names of features on planetary bodies are connected through a specific theme \u0026ndash; for example, many features on the Moon have been named after famous scientists. NASA\u0026rsquo;s Dawn mission, together with the International Astronomical Union, established that craters on Ceres would be named for agricultural deities from all over the world, and other features would be named for agricultural festivals. Ceres itself was named after the Roman goddess of corn and harvests by its discoverer, Giuseppe Piazzi, who spotted it with his telescope in 1801. Since March 2015, Dawn has been orbiting Ceres and sending back many intriguing images and other data about its features.\nUsing suggestions from the Dawn team, the IAU recently approved 25 new Ceres feature names tied to theme of agricultural deities, marked in yellow on the map. Emesh Crater, for example, is named for the Sumerian god of vegetation and agriculture. Jumi is the Latvian god of fertility of the field.\nThe newly named surface features vary in size. Thrud, for example, is a crater with a diameter of 4.8 miles (7.8 kilometers) within the larger crater Zadeni, while Mlezi has a diameter of 28 miles (42 kilometers).\nFor more information, the characteristics of these and other features on Ceres can be found in the IAU\u0026rsquo;s Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature.\nSource.\nCaption Researchers from NASA\u0026rsquo;s Dawn mission have composed the first comprehensive views of the north (left) and south pole regions (right) of dwarf planet Ceres, using images obtained by the Dawn spacecraft. The images were taken between Aug. 17 and Oct. 23, 2015, from an altitude of 915 miles (1,470 kilometers).\nThe region around the south pole appears black in this view because this area has been in shade ever since Dawn\u0026rsquo;s arrival on March 6, 2015, and is therefore not visible.\nAt the north polar region, craters Jarovit, Ghanan and Asari are visible, as well as the mountain Ysolo Mons. Near the south pole, craters Attis and Zadeni can be seen.\nDetailed maps of the polar regions allow researchers to study the craters in this area and compare them to those covering other parts of Ceres. Variations in shape and complexity can point to different surface compositions. In addition, the bottoms of some craters located close to the poles receive no sunlight throughout Ceres\u0026rsquo; orbit around the sun. Scientists want to investigate whether surface ice can be found there.\nSource.\nQuadrangles # Based on Dawn\u0026rsquo;s data # The definition of Ceres\u0026rsquo; quadrangles, prefixed Ac, is also defined in \u0026ldquo;The geologic mapping of Ceres\u0026rdquo; [2].\nHowever, another article [3] offers this map, which reports the name of all quadrangles:\nNotice how, unlike many other solar system bodies, these quadrangles names are in alphabetical order.\nPre-existing definitions # A different, provisional definition of Ceres quadrangles was made in 2015, before Dawn\u0026rsquo;s mission, based on telescope observations.\nKeep in mind that this nomenclature is now completely outdated. I also could not find the publication that proposed this definition.\nPrime meridian # Ceres\u0026rsquo; prime meridian is defined by the tiny equatorial Kait crater (marked on the main map above)[4].

Source.\nTopographic map # Caption This color-coded map from NASA\u0026rsquo;s Dawn mission shows the highs and lows of topography on the surface of dwarf planet Ceres. It is labeled with names of features approved by the International Astronomical Union.\nThe color scale extends about 5 miles (7.5 kilometers) below the reference surface in indigo to 5 miles (7.5 kilometers) above the reference surface in white.\nThe brightest spots on Ceres, located in Occator crater, retain their bright appearance in this map, although they are color-coded in the same green elevation of the crater floor in which they sit. The one named mountain on Ceres is called Ysolo Mons, and lies high in the northern hemisphere at upper left.\nThe topographic map was constructed from analyzing images from Dawn\u0026rsquo;s framing camera taken from varying sun and viewing angles. The map was combined with an image mosaic of Ceres and rendered as a simple cylindrical projection. Not pictured is Kait crater, which lies on longitude 0.\nSource.\nGeological map # No complete geological maps of Ceres seems to be freely available at the moment, although they exist. Such map was likely published in [2].\nOther articles refer such geological maps. The best accessible images comes from [3], which contains this low-res image.\nInteractive maps # NASA Trek # NASA Trek is also available for Ceres, based on the same data: https://trek.nasa.gov/ceres\n3D Model # NASA offers an interactive 3D model of Ceres in its Solar System 3D explorer: https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/1_ceres\nOrbit and rotation # Sources:\nOrbital characteristics # Orbits of Ceres (red, inclined) along with Jupiter and the inner planets (white and grey). The upper diagram shows Ceres\u0026rsquo;s orbit from top down. The bottom diagram is a side view showing Ceres\u0026rsquo;s orbital inclination to the ecliptic. Lighter shades indicate above the ecliptic; darker indicate below. Source.\nCeres orbits between Mars and Jupiter, near the middle of the asteroid belt, with an orbital period (Cererian year) of 4.6 terrestrial years. Compared to other planets and dwarf planets, Ceres\u0026rsquo;s orbit is moderately tilted with its inclination of 10.6° (compare with Earth\u0026rsquo;s 7.155°), and it is also slightly elongated, with an eccentricity of 0.08 (compare with Earth\u0026rsquo;s 0.0167086).\nRotation and axial tilt # The rotation period of Ceres (the Cererian day) is 9 hours and 4 minutes, prograde (east to west).\nThe north polar axis points at right ascension 19 h 25 m 40.3 s (291.418°), declination +66° 45\u0026rsquo; 50\u0026quot; (about 1.5 degrees from Delta Draconis), which means an axial tilt of 4°. This means that Ceres currently sees little to no seasonal variation in sunlight by latitude.\nOrbital resonances # Due to their small masses and the large distances between them, objects within the asteroid belt rarely fall into gravitational resonances with each other.\nHowever, Ceres is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 1:1 resonances (making them temporary trojans), for periods from a few hundred thousand to more than two million years. Fifty such objects have been identified. Ceres is close to a 1:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Pallas (their proper orbital periods differ by 0.2%), but not close enough to be significant over astronomical timescales.\nPhysical characteristics # Ceres is the largest asteroid in the main asteroid belt. It makes up 40% of the estimated (2394±5)×1018 kg mass of the asteroid belt, and it has 3+1⁄2 times the mass of the next asteroid, Vesta, but it is only 1.3% the mass of the Moon.\nAlbedo # Ceres\u0026rsquo;s surface has an albedo of 0.09, which is quite dark compared to the moons in the outer Solar System. This might be a result of the relatively high temperature of Ceres\u0026rsquo;s surface (estimated to about −38 °C, source): in a vacuum, ice is unstable at this temperature. Material left behind by the sublimation of surface ice could explain the dark surface of Ceres compared to the icy moons of the outer Solar System.\nSpectrum # The spectrum of Ceres is similar to that of C-type asteroids. However, since it also has spectral features of carbonates and clay minerals, which are usually absent in the spectra of other C-type asteroids, Ceres is sometimes classified as a G-type asteroid. It has a similar, but not identical, composition to that of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.\nShape # Ceres is an oblate spheroid, with an equatorial diameter 8% larger than its polar diameter. Measurements from the Dawn spacecraft found a mean diameter of 939.4 km (583.7 mi) and a mass of 9.38×1020 kg. This gives Ceres a density of 2.16 g/cm3, suggesting that a quarter of its mass is water ice.\nCeres is close to being in hydrostatic equilibrium, but some deviations from an equilibrium shape have yet to be explained. Assuming it is in equilibrium, Ceres is the only dwarf planet with an orbital period less than that of Neptune.\nMagnetic field # Because Dawn lacked a magnetometer, it is not known if Ceres has a magnetic field; it is believed not to.\nGeology # Dawn found Ceres\u0026rsquo;s surface to be a mixture of water ice and hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay. Gravity data suggest Ceres to be partially differentiated into a muddy (ice-rock) mantle/core and a less dense but stronger crust that is at most thirty percent ice by volume.\nAlthough Ceres likely lacks an internal ocean of liquid water, brines still flow through the outer mantle and reach the surface, allowing cryovolcanoes such as Ahuna Mons to form roughly every fifty million years. This makes Ceres the closest known cryovolcanically active body to the Sun, and the brines provide a potential habitat for microbial life.\nSurface composition # The surface composition of Ceres is homogeneous on a global scale, and it is rich in carbonates and ammoniated phyllosilicates that have been altered by water, though water ice in the regolith varies from approximately 10% in polar latitudes to much drier, even ice-free, in the equatorial regions [5].\nStudies using the Hubble Space Telescope show graphite, sulfur, and sulfur dioxide on Ceres\u0026rsquo;s surface. The graphite is evidently the result of space weathering on Ceres\u0026rsquo;s older surfaces; the latter two are volatile under Cererian conditions and would be expected to either escape quickly or settle in cold traps, and so are evidently associated with areas with relatively recent geological activity.\nOrganic compounds were detected in Ernutet Crater, and most of the planet\u0026rsquo;s near surface is rich in carbon, at approximately 20% by mass. The carbon content is more than five times higher than in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites analysed on Earth. The surface carbon shows evidence of being mixed with products of rock-water interactions, such as clays.\nThis chemistry suggests Ceres formed in a cold environment, perhaps outside the orbit of Jupiter, and that it accreted from ultra-carbon-rich materials in the presence of water, which could provide conditions favourable to organic chemistry.\nCraters # Impact craters on Ceres exhibit a wide range of appearances. A large number of Cererian craters have central peaks. By correlating the presence or absence of central peaks with the sizes of the craters, scientists can infer the properties of Ceres’s crust, such as how strong it is. Rather than a peak at the center, some craters contain large pits, depressions that may be a result of gases escaping after the impact [6].\nThe surface of Ceres has a large number of craters with low relief, indicating that they lie over a relatively soft surface, probably of water ice. Kerwan crater is extremely low relief, with a diameter of 283.88 kilometers, reminiscent of large, flat craters on Tethys and Iapetus. It is distinctly shallow for its size, and lacks a central peak, which may have been destroyed by a 15-kilometer-wide crater at the center. The crater is likely to be old relative to the rest of Ceres\u0026rsquo;s surface, because it is overlapped by nearly every other feature in the area.\nDawn revealed that Ceres has a heavily cratered surface, though with fewer large craters than expected. Models based on the formation of the current asteroid belt had predicted Ceres should have ten to fifteen craters larger than 400 km in diameter. The largest confirmed crater on Ceres, Kerwan Basin, is 284 km across. The most likely reason for this is viscous relaxation of the crust slowly flattening out larger impacts.\nCeres\u0026rsquo;s north polar region shows far more cratering than the equatorial region, with the eastern equatorial region in particular comparatively lightly cratered. The overall size frequency of craters of between twenty and a hundred kilometres is consistent with their having originated in the Late Heavy Bombardment, with craters outside the ancient polar regions likely erased by early cryovolcanism. Three large shallow basins (planitiae) with degraded rims are likely to be eroded craters. The largest, Vendimia Planitia, at 800 km across, is also the largest single geographical feature on Ceres. Two of the three have higher than average ammonium concentrations.\nDawn observed 4,423 boulders larger than 105 m in diameter on the surface of Ceres. These boulders likely formed through impacts, and are found within or near craters, though not all craters contain boulders. Large boulders are more numerous at higher latitudes. Boulders on Ceres are brittle and degrade rapidly due to thermal stress (at dawn and dusk, the surface temperature changes rapidly) and meteoritic impacts. Their maximum age is estimated to be 150 million years, much shorter than the lifetime of boulders on Vesta.\nPermanently shadowed craters # Your browser does not support the video tag. Permanently shadowed regions capable of accumulating surface ice were identified in the northern hemisphere of Ceres using images taken by NASA’s Dawn mission combined with sophisticated computer modeling of illumination (7 July 2016). Source.\nCeres\u0026rsquo; axial tilt is small enough for its polar regions to contain permanently shadowed craters that are expected to act as cold traps and accumulate water ice over time. About 0.14% of water molecules released from the surface are expected to end up in the traps, hopping an average of three times before escaping or being trapped.\nGravitational influence from Jupiter and Saturn over the course of three million years has triggered cyclical shifts in Ceres\u0026rsquo;s axial tilt, ranging from two to twenty degrees, meaning that seasonal variation in sun exposure has occurred in the past, with the last period of seasonal activity estimated at 14,000 years ago. Those craters that remain in shadow during periods of maximum axial tilt are the most likely to retain water ice from eruptions or cometary impacts over the age of the Solar System.\nFigures # Name:\nMPC designation: 1 Ceres Pronunciation: /ˈsɪəriːz/, SEER-eez Adjectives: Cererian, -ean (/sɪˈrɪəriən/) Symbol: ⚳ Orbital characteristics\nAphelion: 2.98 AU (446 million km) Perihelion: 2.55 AU (381 million km) Semi-major axis: 2.77 AU (414 million km) Eccentricity: 0.0785 Orbital period (sidereal): 4.60 yr (1680 d) Orbital period (synodic): 1.28 yr (466.6 d) Average orbital speed: 17.9 km/s Mean anomaly: 291.4° Inclination: 10.6° to ecliptic 9.20° to invariable plane Longitude of ascending node: 80.3° Time of perihelion: 7 December 2022 Argument of perihelion: 73.6° Satellites: None Proper orbital elements\nProper semi-major axis: 2.77 AU Proper eccentricity: 0.116 Proper inclination: 9.65° Proper mean motion: 78.2 deg / yr Proper orbital period: 4.60358 yr (1681.458 d) Precession of perihelion: 54.1 arcsec / yr Precession of the ascending node: −59.2 arcsec / yr Physical characteristics\nDimensions: (966.2 × 962.0 × 891.8) ± 0.2 km Mean diameter: 939.4±0.2 km Surface area: 2,772,368 km2 Volume: 434,000,000 km3 Mass: 9.3839×1020 kg (0.00016 Earths or 0.0128 Moons) Mean density: 2.1616±0.0025 g/cm3 Equatorial surface gravity: 0.284 m/s2 (0.029 g) Moment of inertia factor: 0.36±0.15 (estimate) Equatorial escape velocity: 0.516 km/s 1141 mph Sidereal rotation period: 9.074170±0.000001 h Equatorial rotation velocity: 92.61 m/s Axial tilt: ≈4° North pole right ascension: 291.42744° North pole declination: 66.76033° Geometric albedo: 0.090±0.0033 (V-band) Min surface temp.: ≈110K Max surface temp.: 235±4K Spectral type: C Apparent magnitude: 7.6 to 9.3 Absolute magnitude (H): 3.34 Angular diameter: 0.854″ to 0.339″ References # [1]: \u0026ldquo;Dawn at Ceres: What Have we Learned?\u0026rdquo; https://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/ssbsite/documents/webpage/ssb_183286.pdf\n[2]: \u0026ldquo;Introduction: The geologic mapping of Ceres\u0026rdquo; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.05.004\n[3]: “A Cartographic Perspective on the Planetary Geologic Mapping Investigation of Ceres” https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15174209, backup\n[4]: \u0026ldquo;Ceres Coordinate System Description\u0026rdquo; https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/pds3/dawn/fc/DWNCSPC_4_01/DOCUMENT/CERES_COORD_SYS_180628.HTM\n[5]: \u0026ldquo;Dawn Data Reveal Ceres’ Complex Crustal Evolution\u0026rdquo; https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2018/EPSC2018-645-1.pdf\n[6]: \u0026ldquo;Dawn Journal: Ceres\u0026rsquo; Intriguing Geology\u0026rdquo; https://www.planetary.org/articles/0630-dawn-journal-ceres-intriguing-geology.

This series is based on data from the Galileo Orbiter Solid-State Imaging (SSI) camera and the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft.\nPROJECTION Mercator and Polar Stereographic projections used for this map of Europa are based on a sphere having a radius of 1,562.09 km. The scale is 1:8,388,000 at ±56° latitude for both projections. Longitude increases to the west in accordance with the International Astronomical Union (1971; Davies and others, 1996). Latitude is planetographic.\nCONTROL The process of creating a geometric control network began with selecting control points on the individual images, making pixel measurements of their locations, using reseau locations to correct for geometric distortions, and converting the measurements to millimeters in the focal plane. These data are combined with the camera focal lengths and navigation solutions as input to a photogrammetric triangulation solution (Davies and others, 1998; Davies and Katayama, 1981). The solution used here was computed at the RAND Corporation in June 2000. Solved parameters include the radius (given above) of the best-fitting sphere, the coordinates of the con- trol points, the three orientation angles of the camera at each exposure (right ascension, declination, and twist), and an angle (W0) that defines the orientation of Europa in space. W0—in this solution 36.022°—is the angle along the equator to the east, between the 0° meridian and the equator’s intersection with the celestial equator at the standard epoch J2000.0. This solution places the crater Cilix at its defined longitude of 182° west (Davies and others, 1996).\nMAPPING TECHNIQUE This global map base uses the best image quality and moderate resolution coverage supplied by Galileo SSI and Voyager 1 and 2 (Batson, 1987; Becker and others, 1998; 1999; 2001). The digital map was produced using Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) (Eliason, 1997; Gaddis and others, 1997; Torson and Becker, 1997). The individual images were radiometrically calibrated and photometrically normalized using a Lunar-Lambert function with empirically derived values (McEwen, 1991; Kirk and others, 2000). A linear correction based on the statistics of all overlapping areas was then applied to minimize image brightness varia- tions. The image data were selected on the basis of overall image quality, reasonable original input resolution (from 20 km/pixel for gap fill to as much as 40 m/pixel), and availability of moderate emission/incidence angles for topography and albedo. Although consistency was achieved where possible, different filters were included for global image coverage as necessary: clear/blue for Voyager 1 and 2; clear, near-IR (757 nm), and green (559 nm) for Galileo SSI. Individual images were projected to a Sinusoidal Equal-Area projection at an image resolution of 500 m/pixel. The final constructed Sinusoidal projection mosaic was then reprojected to the Mercator and Polar Stereographic projections included on this sheet.\nNOMENCLATURE Names on this sheet are approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU, 1980, 1986, 1999, and 2001).

With an orbital eccentricity of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s equatorial plane is small, at 0.470°. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa\u0026rsquo;s surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa\u0026rsquo;s prime meridian (0 longitude) is a line passing through this point.\nRemember also that:\nApparent size / 3438 arcminutes = Diameter (km) / Distance (km)\nConsidering this, the height of Jupiter in the sky is equivalent to the latitude-longitude coordinates of any given point, flipped. For example at 10°S 5°E, Jupiter appears in the sky close to the zenith, at 10°N 5°W. Past 90°E/W, Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s center is below the horizon, but it\u0026rsquo;s partially visible for a few more degrees (half of its apparent diameter).\nJupiter\u0026rsquo;s apparent diameter is 13.4° wide when seen from Europa: Jupiter has a diameter of 142,000 km, Europa has a diameter of 2960 km, and distance varies between 604,000 and 592,000 km.\nLeading/trailing hemisphere # The leading hemisphere is the one facing the direction of motion of the moon while orbiting Jupiter. The trailing hemisphere is its opposite. So the \u0026ldquo;subjovian\u0026rdquo; hemisphere overlaps for 90° with the western half of the trailing hemisphere and for 90° with the eastern half of the leading hemisphere.\nImage of Europa\u0026rsquo;s trailing emisphere. North up. https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00502\nThis image shows two views of the trailing hemisphere of Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s ice-covered satellite, Europa. The left image shows the approximate natural color appearance of Europa. The image on the right is a false-color composite version combining violet, green and infrared images to enhance color differences in the predominantly water-ice crust of Europa. Dark brown areas represent rocky material derived from the interior, implanted by impact, or from a combination of interior and exterior sources. Bright plains in the polar areas (top and bottom) are shown in tones of blue to distinguish possibly coarse-grained ice (dark blue) from fine-grained ice (light blue). Long, dark lines are fractures in the crust, some of which are more than 3,000 kilometers (1,850 miles) long. The bright feature containing a central dark spot in the lower third of the image is a young impact crater some 50 kilometers (31 miles) in diameter. This crater has been provisionally named \u0026ldquo;Pwyll\u0026rdquo; for the Celtic god of the underworld.\nEuropa is about 3,160 kilometers (1,950 miles) in diameter, or about the size of Earth\u0026rsquo;s moon. This image was taken on September 7, 1996, at a range of 677,000 kilometers (417,900 miles) by the solid state imaging television camera onboard the Galileo spacecraft during its second orbit around Jupiter. The image was processed by Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fuer Luftund Raumfahrt e.V., Berlin, Germany.\nCrater on the right is Pwyll, the one on the right Callanish, the spot right under the wide crossing lineae is Conamara Chaos.\nJupiter from various locations # Callanish Crater 16.70°S 25.5°E (Je-10 \u0026ldquo;Callanish\u0026rdquo;, quadrangle name arbitrary).

Jupiter zaps Europa’s surface night and day with electrons and other particles, bathing it in high-energy radiation. But as these particles pound the moon’s surface, they may also be doing something otherworldly: making Europa glow in the dark.\nNew research from scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California details for the first time what the glow would look like, and what it could reveal about the composition of ice on Europa’s surface. Different salty compounds react differently to the radiation and emit their own unique glimmer. To the naked eye, this glow would look sometimes slightly green, sometimes slightly blue or white and with varying degrees of brightness, depending on what material it is.\nScientists use a spectrometer to separate the light into wavelengths and connect the distinct “signatures,” or spectra, to different compositions of ice. Most observations using a spectrometer on a moon like Europa are taken using reflected sunlight on the moon’s dayside, but these new results illuminate what Europa would look like in the dark. [\u0026hellip;]\nScientists have inferred from prior observations that Europa’s surface could be made of a mix of ice and commonly known salts on Earth, such as magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) and sodium chloride (table salt). The new research shows that incorporating those salts into water ice under Europa-like conditions and blasting it with radiation produces a glow.\nThat much was not a surprise. It’s easy to imagine an irradiated surface glowing. [\u0026hellip;] “But we never imagined that we would see what we ended up seeing,” said JPL’s Bryana Henderson, who co-authored the research. “When we tried new ice compositions, the glow looked different. And we all just stared at it for a while and then said, ‘This is new, right? This is definitely a different glow?’ So we pointed a spectrometer at it, and each type of ice had a different spectrum.”\nNote that at the time of the article (2020), no mission observed this glow yet. It\u0026rsquo;s a lab prediction.\nPenitentes # Context: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penitente_(snow_formation)\nPenitentes, or nieves penitentes (Spanish for \u0026ldquo;penitent snows\u0026rdquo;), are snow formations found at high altitudes. They take the form of elongated, thin blades of hardened snow or ice, closely spaced and pointing towards the general direction of the sun. [\u0026hellip;]\nThese spires of snow and ice grow over all glaciated and snow-covered areas in the Dry Andes above 4,000 metres (13,000 ft). They range in length from a few centimetres to over 5 metres (16 ft) [on Earth]. [\u0026hellip;]\nPenitentes up to 15 metres (49 ft) high are suggested to be present in the tropics zone on Europa, a satellite of Jupiter.\nArticle: https://www.space.com/42051-jupiter-moon-europa-ice-towers-lander.html ( Backup)\nEquatorial regions of the potentially life-supporting Europa, which harbors a huge ocean of salty liquid water beneath its icy shell, are probably studded with blades of ice up to 50 feet (15 meters) tall, a new study suggests. [\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;Clearly, the paper suggests very strongly that the tropics of Europa are going to be spiky, and it would be unwise to plan to land there without a specially adapted lander,\u0026rdquo; study lead author Dan Hobley, a lecturer in the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at Cardiff University in Wales, told Space.com via email. \u0026ldquo;It would probably be safer to land further away from the equator!\u0026rdquo;\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no reason to believe this process is restricted to our planet. Indeed, scientists think the \u0026ldquo;bladed terrain\u0026rdquo; spotted on Pluto by NASA\u0026rsquo;s New Horizons spacecraft likely consists of penitentes carved into methane ice.\nEuropa would seem to a good bet for penitente gardens as well; after all, it\u0026rsquo;s a cold, dry, virtually air-free world that\u0026rsquo;s entirely covered in ice. So Hobley and his colleagues calculated sublimation rates around the surface of the Jupiter moon and then compared those with the rates of other erosional processes. Those processes include bombardment by meteoroids and charged particles from Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s powerful radiation belts.\nThe researchers found sublimation to be the dominant factor on equatorial Europa, the regions within 23 degrees of the moon\u0026rsquo;s equator. And sublimation has likely carved penitentes into the ice there, the study team determined. These are some serious putative penitentes, too: some fields could feature towers up to 50 feet (15 m) tall, spaced about 23 feet (7 m) apart, the scientists found. Here on Earth, penitente heights typically range from 3 to 16 feet (1 to 5 m).\nOriginal article: s41561-018-0235-0\nNote that at the time of the article (2018), no mission observed penitentes on Europa yet. It\u0026rsquo;s a prediction.\nLineae # Lineae are relatively thin. From available pictures they seem to be about 2km wide, the equivalent of 30min walking or 10-15mins running.\nNote: this is not the time it would take to cross the same distance on Europa. The terrain is likely really harsh (see Penitentes) and there are slopes. On top of it the gravity is moon-like, which severely affects balance even in normal conditions, and the ground is made of salty ice, which makes is very slippery. The most likely \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo; method of moving on the surface is some sort of \u0026ldquo;skating\u0026rdquo; where flat, and honestly I have no idea what in the case of blades. Probably one would need to jump over them. At that gravity, jumping is slow and best done horizontally. Etc etc. I should summarize the difficulties of moving in a low gravity, ragged icy surface in another page.\nExample: 15ESREGMAP01 (Galileo mosaic from https://www.planetary.org/space-images/lineae-on-europa, original source likely here but dead).

This mosaic of Galileo SSI images from 1998 and 1999 runs from Mehen Linea at the top of the frame, across the intersection of Minos and Udaeus Lineae, and finally to the lenticulated terrain northwest of Dyfed Regio. The resolution of this mosaic is 228 meters per pixel. (NASA / JPL / Jason Perry)\nThe lineae thickness is about 16-20px overall, which sums up to 4km wide in the widest possible point I could find. Consider also that these are among the widest lineae I could locate on the map. Kennet, for comparison, is thinner.\nGeysers # Article: https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-europa-water-vapor ( Backup )\nPrevious scientific findings from other sources already point to the existence of an ocean located under Europa\u0026rsquo;s icy crust. Researchers are not yet fully certain whether the detected water vapor is generated by erupting water plumes on the surface, but they are confident this is the most likely explanation. [\u0026hellip;]\nHubble spectroscopic observations provided the evidence for Europa plumes in December 2012. Time sampling of Europa\u0026rsquo;s auroral emissions measured by Hubble\u0026rsquo;s imaging spectrograph enabled the researchers to distinguish between features created by charged particles from Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s magnetic bubble and plumes from Europa\u0026rsquo;s surface, and also to rule out more exotic explanations such as serendipitously observing a rare meteorite impact.\nThe imaging spectrograph detected faint ultraviolet light from an aurora, powered by Jupiter’s intense magnetic field, near the moon’s south pole. Excited atomic oxygen and hydrogen produce a variable auroral glow and leave a telltale sign that are the products of water molecules being broken apart by electrons along magnetic field lines.\n“We pushed Hubble to its limits to see this very faint emission. These could be stealth plumes, because they might be tenuous and difficult to observe in the visible light,” said Joachim Saur of the University of Cologne, Germany. Saur, who is principal investigator of the Hubble observation campaign, co-wrote the paper with Roth. He suggested that long cracks on Europa’s surface, known as lineae, might be venting water vapor into space. Cassini has seen similar fissures that host the Enceladus jets.\nAlso the Hubble team found that the intensity of the Europa plumes, like those at Enceladus, varies with Europa’s orbital position. Active jets have only been seen when the moon is farthest from Jupiter. The researchers could not detect any sign of venting when Europa is closer to Jupiter.\nOne explanation for the variability is that these lineae experience more stress as gravitational tidal forces push and pull on the moon and open vents at larger distances from Jupiter. The vents are narrowed or closed when the moon is closest to the gas-giant planet. \u0026ldquo;The apparent plume variability supports a key prediction that Europa should tidally flex by a significant amount if it has a subsurface ocean,\u0026rdquo; said Kurt Retherford, also of Southwest Research Institute.\nThe Europa and Enceladus plumes have remarkably similar abundances of water vapor. Because Europa has a roughly 12 times stronger gravitational pull than Enceladus, the minus-40-degree-Fahrenheit (minus-40-degree-Celsius) vapor for the most part doesn’t escape into space as it does at Enceladus, but rather falls back onto the surface after reaching an altitude of 125 miles (201 kilometers), according to the Hubble measurements. This could leave bright surface features near the moon’s south polar region, the researchers hypothesize.\nNote also here that at the time of the article (2013), this is a prediction based on Hubble observations and parallels with Enceladus. Direct observations on Europa are still weak.\nAccording to Wikipedia new studies based on the same data seems to confirm the same.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/site/library/keyes-flowers-for-algernon/","title":"Flowers for Algernon","section":"Library","content":"progris riport 1-martch 5, 1965\nDr. Strauss says I shud rite down what I think and evrey thing that happins to me from now on, I dont know why but he says its importint so they will see if they will use me.

They said why did you want to. I told them becaus all my life I wantid to be smart and not dumb. But its very hard to be smart. They said you know it will probly be tempirery. I said yes. Miss Kinnian told me. I dont care if it herts. Later I had more crazy tests today. The nice lady who gave it to me told me the name and I asked her how do you spell it so I can rite it my progris riport. THEMATIC APPERCEPTION TEST. I dont know the frist 2 words but I know what test means. You got to pass it or you get bad marks. This test lookd easy becaus I could see the picturs. Only this time she dint want me to tell her the picturs. That mixd me up. She said make up storys about the pepul in the picturs. I told her how can you tell storys about pepul you never met. I said why shud I make up lies. I never tell lies any more becaus I always get caut. She told me this test and the other one the raw-shok was for getting personality. I laffed so hard. I said how can you get that thing from inkblots and fotos. She got sore and put her picturs away. I don't care. It was sily. I gess I faled that test too. Later some men in white coats took me to a difernt part of the hospitil and gave me a game to play. It was like a race with a white mouse. They called the mouse Algernon. Algernon was in a box with a lot of twists and turns like all kinds of walls and they gave me a pencil and a paper with lines and lots of boxes. On one side it said START and on the other end it said FINISH. They said it was amazed and that Algernon and me had the same amazed to do. I dint see how we could have the same amazed if Algernon had a box and I had a paper but I dint say' nothing. Anyway there wasnt time because the race started. One of the men had a watch he was trying to hide so I wouldnt see it so I tryed not to look and that made me nervus. Anyway that test made me feel worser than all the others because they' did it over 10 times with different amazeds and Algernon won every time. I dint know that mice were so smart, Maybe thats because Algernon is a white mouse. Maybe white mice are smarter than other mice. progris riport 4-Mar 8 Their going to use me! Im so excited I can hardly write. Dr Nemur and Dr Strauss had a argament about it first. Dr Nemur was in the office when Dr Strauss brot me in. Dr Nemur was worryed about using me but Dr Strauss told him Miss Kinnian rekemmended me the best from all the people who she was teaching. I like Miss Kinnian becaus shes a very smart teacher. And she said Charlie your going to have a second chance. If you volunteer for this experament you mite get smart. They dont know if it will be perminint but theirs a chance. Thats why I said ok even when I was scared because she said it was an operashun. She said dont be scared Charlie you done so much with so little I think you deserv it most of all. So I got scaird when Dr. Nemur and Dr. Strauss argud about it. Dr. Strauss said I had something that was very good. He said I had a good motorvation. I never even knew I had that. I felt proud when he said that not every body with an eye-q of 68 had that thing. I dant know what it is or where I got it but he said Algernon had it too. Algernons motor-vation is the cheese they put in his box. But it cant be that because I didn't eat any cheese this week. Then he told Dr Nemur something I dint understand so while they were talking I wrote down some of the words. He said Dr. Nemur I know Charlie is not what you had in mind as the first of your new brede of intelek** (couldnt get the word) superman. But most people of his low ment** are host** and uncoop** they are usually dull apath** and hard to reach. He has a good natcher hes intristed and eager to please. Dr Nemur said remember he will be the first human beeng ever to have his intelijence tripled by surgicle meens. Dr. Strauss said exakly. Look at how well hes lerned to read and write for his low mentel age its as grate an acheve** as you and I lerning einstines therey of **vity without help. That shows the inteness motor-vation. Its comparat** a tremen** achev** I say we use Charlie. I dint get all the words but it sounded like Dr Strauss was on my side and like the other one wasnt. Then Dr Nemur nodded he said all right maybe your right. We will use Charlie. When he said that I got so exited I jumped up and shook his hand for being so good to me. I told him thank you doc you wont be sorry for giving me a second chance. And I mean it like I told him. After the operashun Im gonna try to be smart. Im gonna try awful hard. progris riport 5-Mar 10 Im skared. Lots of the nurses and the people who gave me the tests came to bring me candy and wish me luck. I hope I have luck. I got my rabits foot and my lucky penny. Only a black cat crossed me when I was comming to the hospitil. Dr Strauss says dont be supersitis Charlie this is science. Anyway Im keeping my rabits foot with me. I asked Dr Strauss if Ill beat Algernon in the race after the operashun and he said maybe. If the operashun works Ill show that mouse I can be as smart as he is. Maybe smarter. Then Ill be abel to read better and spell the words good and know lots of things and be like other people. I want to be smart like other people. If it works perminint they will make everybody smart all over the wurld. They dint give me anything to eat this morning. I dont know what that eating has to do with getting smart. Im very hungry and Dr. Nemur took away my box of candy. That Dr Nemur is a grouch. Dr Strauss says I can have it back after the operashun. You cant eat befor a operashun.... progress report 6-Mar 15 The operashun dint hurt. He did it while I was sleeping. They took off the bandijis from my head today so I can make a PROG- RESS REPORT. Dr. Nemur who looked at some of my other ones says I spell PROGRESS wrong and told me how to spell it and REPORT too. I got to try and remember that. I have a very bad memary for spelling. Dr Strauss says its ok to tell about all the things that happin to me but he says I should tell more about what I feel and what I think. When I told him I dont know how to think he said try. All the time when the bandijis were on my eyes I tryed to think. Nothing happened. I dont know what to think about. Maybe if I ask him he will tell me how I can think now that Im supposed to get smart. What do smart people think about. Fancy things I suppose. I wish I knew some fancy things alredy. progress report 7-mar 19 Nothing is happining. I had lots of tests and different kinds of races with Algernon. I hate that mouse. He always beats me. Dr. Strauss said I got to play those games. And he said some time I got to take those tests over again. Those inkblots are stupid. And those pictures are stupid too. I like to draw a picture of a man and a woman but I wont make up lies about people. I got a headache from trying to think so much. I thot Dr Strauss was my frend but he dont help me. He dont tell me what to think or when Ill get smart. Miss Kinnian dint come to see me. I think writing these progress reports are stupid too. progress report 8-Mar 23 Im going back to work at the factory. They said it was better I shud go back to work but I cant tell anyone what the operashun was for and I have to come to the hospitil for an hour evry night after work. They are gonna pay me mony every month for learning to be smart. Im glad Im going back to work because I miss my job and all my frends and all the fun we have there. Dr Strauss say's I shud keep writing things down but I dont have to do it every day just when I think of something or something speshul happins. He says dont get discoridged because it takes time and it happins slow. He say's it took a long time with Algernon before he got 3 times smarter than he was before. Thats why Algernon beats me all the time because he had that operashun too. That makes me feel better. I coud probly do that amazed faster than a reglar mouse. Maybe some day Ill beat him. That would be something. So far Algernon looks smart perminent. Mar 25 (I dont have to write PROGRESS REPORT on top any more just when I hand it in once a week for Dr Nemur. I just have to put the date on. That saves time) We had a lot of fun at the factory today. Joe Carp said hey look where Charlie had his operashun what did they do Charlie put some brains in. I was going to tell him but I remembered Dr Strauss said no. Then Frank Reilly said what did you do Charlie forget your key and open your door the hard way. That made me laff. Their really my friends and they like me. Sometimes somebody will say hey look at Joe or Frank or George he really pulled a Charlie Gordon. I dont know why they say that but they always laff. This morning Amos Borg who is the 4 man at Donnegans used my name when he shouted at Ernie the office boy. Ernie lost a packige. He said Ernie for godsake what are you trying to be a Charlie Gordon. I dont understand why he said that. Mar 28 Dr Strauss came to my room tonight to see why I dint come in like I was suppose to. I told him I dont like to race with Algernon any more. He said I dont have to for a while but I shud come in. He had a present for me. I thot it was a little television but it wasnt. He said I got to turn it on when I go to sleep. I said your kidding why shud I turn it on when Im going to sleep. Who ever herd of a thing like that. But he said if I want to get smart I got to do what he says. I told him I dint think I was going to get smart and he puts his hand on my sholder and said Charlie you dont know it yet but your getting smarter all the time. You wont notice for a while. I think he was just being nice to make me feel good because I dont look any smarter. Oh yes I almost forgot. I asked him when I can go back to the class at Miss Kinnians school. He said I wont go their. He said that soon Miss Kinnian will come to the hospitil to start and teach me speshul. Mar 29 That crazy TV kept up all night. How can I sleep with something yelling crazy things all night in my ears. And the nutty pictures. Wow. I don't know what it says when Im up so how am I going to know when Im sleeping. Dr Strauss says its ok. He says my brains are lerning when I sleep and that will help me when Miss Kinnian starts my lessons in the hospitl (only I found out it isn't a hospitil its a labatory.) I think its all crazy. If you can get smart when your sleeping why do people go to school. That thing I don't think will work. I use to watch the late show and the late late show on TV all the time and it never made me smart. Maybe you have to sleep while you watch it. progress report 9-April 3 Dr Strauss showed me how to keep the TV turned low so now I can sleep. I don't hear a thing. And I still dont understand what it says. A few times I play it over in the morning to find out what I lerned when I was sleeping and I don't think so. Miss Kinnian says Maybe its another langwidge. But most times it sound american. It talks faster then even Miss Gold who was my teacher in 6 grade. I told Dr. Strauss what good is it to get smart in my sleep. I want to be smart when Im awake. He says its the same thing and I have two minds. Theres the subconscious and the conscious (thats how you spell it). And one dont tell the other one what its doing. They dont even talk to each other. Thats why I dream. And boy have I been having crazy dreams. Wow. Ever since that night TV. The late late late show. I forgot to ask him if it was only me or if everybody had those two minds. (I just looked up the word in the dictionary Dr Strauss gave me. The word is subconscious. adj. Of the nature of mental operations yet not present in consciousness; as, subconscious conflict of de- sires.) There's more but I still dont know what it means. This isnt a very good dictionary for dumb people like me. Anyway the headache is from the party. My friends from the factery Joe Carp and Frank Reilly invited me to go to Muggsys Saloon for some drinks. I don't like to drink but they said we will have lots of fun. I had a good time. Joe Carp said I shoud show the girls how I mop out the toilet in the factory and he got me a mop. I showed them and everyone laffed when I told that Mr. Donnegan said I was the best janiter he ever had because I like my job and do it good and never miss a day except for my operashun. I said Miss Kinnian always said Charlie be proud of your job because you do it good. Everybody laffed and we had a good time and they gave me lots of drinks and Joe said Charlie is a card when hes potted. I dont know what that means but everybody likes me and we have fun. I cant wait to be smart like my best friends Joe Carp and Frank Reilly. I dont remember how the party was over but I think I went out to buy a newspaper and coffe for Joe and Frank and when I came back there was no one their. I looked for them all over till late. Then I dont remember so good but I think I got sleepy or sick. A nice cop brot me back home Thats what my landlady Mrs Flynn says. But I got a headache and a big lump on my head. I think maybe I fell but Joe Carp says it was the cop they beat up drunks some times. I don't think so. Miss Kinnian says cops are to help people. Anyway I got a bad headache and Im sick and hurt all over. I dont think Ill drink anymore. April 6 I beat Algernon! I dint even know I beat him until Burt the tester told me. Then the second time I lost because I got so exited I fell off the chair before I finished. But after that I beat him 8 more times. I must be getting smart to beat a smart mouse like Algernon. But I dont feel smarter. I wanted to race Algernon some more but Burt said thats enough for one day. They let me hold him for a minit. Hes not so bad. Hes soft like a ball of cotton. He blinks and when he opens his eyes their black and pink on the eges. I said can I feed him because I felt bad to beat him and I wanted to be nice and make friends. Burt said no Algernon is a very specshul mouse with an operashun like mine, and he was the first of all the animals to stay smart so long. He told me Algernon is so smart that every day he has to solve a test to get his food. Its a thing like a lock on a door that changes every time Algernon goes in to eat so he has to lern something new to get his food. That made me sad because if he couldnt lern he woud be hungry. I don't think its right to make you pass a test to eat. How woud Dr Nemur like it to have to pass a test every time he wants to eat. I think Ill be friends with Algernon. April 9 Tonight after work Miss Kinnian was at the laboratory. She looked like she was glad to see me but scared. I told her dont worry Miss Kinnian Im not smart yet and she laffed. She said I have confidence in you Charlie the way you struggled so hard to read and right better than all the others. At werst you will have it for a littel wile and your doing something for science. We are reading a very hard book. Its called Robinson Crusoe about a man who gets merooned on a dessert Iland. Hes smart and figers out all kinds of things so he can have a house and food and hes a good swimmer. Only I feel sorry because hes all alone and has no frends. But I think their must be somebody else on the iland because theres a picture with his funny umbrella looking at footprints. I hope he gets a frend and not be lonly. April 10 Miss Kinnian teaches me to spell better. She says look at a word and close your eyes and say it over and over until you remember. I have lots of truble with through that you say threw and enough and tough that you dont say enew and tew. You got to say enuff and tuff. Thats how I use to write it before I started to get smart. Im confused but Miss Kinnian says theres no reason in spelling. Apr 14 Finished Robinson Crusoe. I want to find out more about what happens to him but Miss Kinnian says thats all there is. Why. Apr 15 Miss Kinnian says Im lerning fast. She read some of the Progress Reports and she looked at me kind of funny. She says Im a fine person and Ill show them all. I asked her why. She said never mind but I shouldnt feel bad if I find out everybody isnt nice like I think. She said for a person who god gave so little to you done more then a lot of people with brains they never even used. I said all my friends are smart people but there good. They like me and they never did anything that wasnt nice. Then she got something in her eye and she had to run out to the ladys room. Apr 16 Today, I lerned, the comma, this is a comma (,) a period, with a tail, Miss Kinnian, says its importent, because, it makes writing, better, she said, somebody, coud lose, a lot of money, if a comma, isnt, in the, right place, I dont have, any money, and I dont see, how a comma, keeps you, from losing it. Apr 17 1 used the comma wrong. Its punctuation. Miss Kinnian told me to look up long words in the dictionary to lern to spell them. I said whats the difference if you can read it anyway. She said its part of your education so now on Ill look up all the words Im not sure how to spell. It takes a long time to write that way but I only have to look up once and after that I get it right. You got to mix them up, she showed? me\" how to mix! them (and now; I can! mix up all kinds\" of punctuation, in! my writing? There, are lots! of rules? to lern; but Im gettin'g them in my head. One thing I like about, Dear Miss Kinnian: (thats the way it goes in a business letter if I ever go into business) is she, always gives me' a reason\" when—I ask. She's a gen'ius! I wish I cou'd be smart\" like, her; (Punctuation, is; fun!) Apr 18 What a dope I am! I didn't even understand what she was talking about. I read the grammar book last night and it explanes the whole thing. Then I saw it was the same way as Miss Kinnian was trying to tell me, but I didn't get it. Miss Kinnian said that the TV working in my sleep helped out. She and I reached a plateau. Thats a flat hill. After I figured out how punctuation worked, I read over all my old Progress Reports from the beginning. Boy, did I have crazy spelling and punctuation! I told Miss Kinnian I ought to go over the pages and fix all the mistakes but she said, \"No, Charlie, Dr. Nemur wants them just as they are. That's why he let you keep them after they were photostated, to see your own progress. You're coming along fast, Charlie.\" That made me feel good. After the lesson I went down and played with Algernon. We don't race any more. April 20 I feel sick inside. Not sick like for a doctor, but inside my chest it feels empty like getting punched and a heartburn at the same time. I wasn't going to write about it, but I guess I got to, because its important. Today was the first time I ever stayed home from work. Last night Joe Carp and Frank Reilly invited me to a party. There were lots of girls and some men from the factory. I remembered how sick I got last time I drank too much, so I told Joe I didn't want anything to drink. He gave me a plain coke instead. We had a lot of fun for a while. Joe said I should dance with Ellen and she would teach me the steps. I fell a few times and I couldn't understand why because no one else was dancing besides Ellen and me. And all the time I was tripping because somebody's foot was always sticking out. Then when I got up I saw the look on Joe's face and it gave me a funny feeling in my stomack. \"He's a scream,\" one of the girls said. Everybody was laughing. \"Look at him. He's blushing. Charlie is blushing.\" \"Hey, Ellen, what'd you do to Charlie? I never saw him act like that before.\" I didn't know what to do or where to turn. Everyone was looking at me and laughing and I felt naked. I wanted to hide. I ran outside and I threw up. Then I walked home. It's a funny thing I never knew that Joe and Frank and the others liked to have me around all the time to make fun of me. Now I know what it means when they say \"to pull a Charlie Gordon.\" I'm ashamed. PROGRESS REPORT 10\nApril 21 Still didn't go into the factory. I told Mrs. Flynn my landlady to call and tell Mr. Donnegan I was sick. Mrs. Flynn looks at me very funny lately like she's scared. I think it's a good thing about finding out how everybody laughs at me. I thought about it a lot. It's because I'm so dumb and I don't even know when I'm doing something dumb. People think it's funny when a dumb person can't do things the same way they can. Anyway, now I know I'm getting smarter every day. I know punctuation and I can spell good. I like to look up all the hard words in the dictionary and I remember them. I'm reading a lot now, and Miss Kinnian says I read very fast. Sometimes I even understand what I'm reading about, and it stays in my mind. There are times when I can close my eyes and think of a page and it all comes back like a picture. Besides history, geography and arithmetic, Miss Kinnian said I should start to learn foreign languages. Dr. Strauss gave me some more tapes to play while I sleep. I still don't understand how that conscious and unconscious mind works, but Dr. Strauss says not to worry yet. He asked me to promise that when I start learning college subjects next week I wouldn't read any books on psychology-that is, until he gives me permission. I feel a lot better today, but I guess I'm still a little angry that all the time people were laughing and making fun of me because I wasn't so smart. When I become intelligent like Dr. Strauss says, with three times my I.Q. of 68, then maybe I'll be like everyone else and people will like me. I'm not sure what an I.Q. is, Dr. Nemur said it was something that measured how intelligent you were—like a scale in the drug- store weighs pounds. But Dr. Strauss had a big argument with him and said an I.Q. didn't weigh intelligence at all. He said an I.Q. showed how much intelligence you could get, like the numbers on the outside of a measuring cup. You still had to fill the cup up with stuff. Then when I asked Burt, who gives me my intelligence tests and works with Algernon, he said that both of them were wrong (only I had to promise not to tell them he said so). Burt says that the I.Q. measures a lot of different things including some of the things you learned already, and it really isn't any good at all. So I still don't know what I.Q. is except that mine is going to be over 200 soon. I didn't want to say anything, but I don't see how if they don't know what it is, or where it is — I don't see how they know how much of it you've got. Dr. Nemur says I have to take a Rorshach Test tomorrow. I wonder what that is. April 22 I found out what a Rorshach is. It's the test I took before the operation — the one with the inkblots on the pieces of cardboard. I was scared to death of those inkblots. I knew the man was going to ask me to find the pictures and I knew I couldn't. I was thinking to myself, if only there was some way of knowing what kind of pictures were hidden there. Maybe there weren't any pictures at all. Maybe it was just a trick to see if I was dumb enough to look for something that wasn't there. Just thinking about that made me sore at him. \"All right, Charlie,\" he said, \"you've seen these cards before. remember?\" \"Of course I remember.\" The way I said it, he knew I was angry, and he looked surprised. \"Yes, of course. Now I want you to look at this. What might this be? What do you see on this card? People see all sorts of things in these inkblots. Tell me what it might be for you — what it makes you think of.\" I was shocked. That wasn't what I had expected him to say. \"You mean there are no pictures hidden in those inkblots?\" He frowned and took off his glasses. \"What?\" \"Pictures. Hidden in the inkblots. Last time you told me everyone could see them and you wanted me to find them too.\" He explained to me that the last time he had used almost the exact same words he was using now. I didn't believe it, and I still have the suspicion that he misled me at the time just for the fun of it. Unless — I don't know any more — could I have been that feeble-minded? We went through the cards slowly. One looked like a pair of bats tugging at something. Another one looked like two men fencing with swords. I imagined all sorts of things. I guess I got carried away. But I didn't trust him any more, and I kept turning them around, even looking on the back to see if there was anything there I was supposed to catch. While he was making his notes, I peeked out of the corner of my eye to read it. But it was all in code that looked like this: WF+A DdF-Ad orig. WF-A SF + obj The test still doesn't make sense to me. It seems to me that anyone could make up lies about things that they didn't really imagine? Maybe I'll understand it when Dr. Strauss lets me read up on psychology. April 25 I figured out a new way to line up the machines in the factory, and Mr. Donnegan says it will save him ten thousand dollars a year in labor and increased production. He gave me a $25 bonus. I wanted to take Joe Carp and Frank Reilly out to lunch to celebrate, but Joe said he had to buy some things for his wife, and Frank said he was meeting his cousin for lunch. I guess it'll take a little time for them to get used to the changes in me. Everybody seems to be frightened of me. When I went over to Amos Borg and tapped him, he jumped up in the air. People don't talk to me much any more or kid around the way they used to. It makes the job kind of lonely. April 27 I got up the nerve today to ask Miss Kinnian to have dinner with me tomorrow night to celebrate my bonus. At first she wasn't sure it was right, but I asked Dr. Strauss and he said it was okay. Dr. Strauss and Dr. Nemur don't seem to be getting along so well. They're arguing all the time. This evening I heard them shouting. Dr. Nemur was saying that it was his experiment and his research, and Dr. Strauss shouted back that he contributed just as much, because he found me through Miss Kinnian and he performed the operation. Dr. Strauss said that someday thousands of neuro-surgeons might be using his technique all over the world. Dr. Nemur wanted to publish the results of the experiment at the end of the month. Dr. Strauss wanted to wait a while to be sure. Dr. Strauss said Dr. Nemur was more interested in the Chair of Psychology at Princeton than he was in the experiment. Dr. Nemur said Dr. Strauss was nothing but an opportunist trying to ride to glory on his coattails. When I left afterwards, I found myself trembling. I don't know why for sure, but it was as if I'd seen both men clearly for the first time. I remember hearing Burt say Dr. Nemur had a shrew of a wife who was pushing him all the time to get things published so he could become famous. Burt said that the dream of her life was to have a big shot husband. April 28 I don't understand why I never noticed how beautiful Miss Kinnian really is. She has brown eyes and feathery brown hair that comes to the top of her neck. She's only thirty-four! I think from the beginning I had the feeling that she was an unreachable genius - -and very, very old. Now, every time I see her she grows younger and more lovely. We had dinner and a long talk. When she said I was coming along so fast I'd be leaving her behind, I laughed. \"It's true, Charlie. You're already a better reader than I am. You can read a whole page at a glance while I can take in only a few lines at a time. And you remember every single thing you read. I'm lucky if I can recall the main thoughts and the general meaning.\" \"I don't feel intelligent. There are so many things I don't understand.\" She took out a cigarette and I lit it for her. \"You've got to be a little patient. You're accomplishing in days and weeks what it takes normal people to do in a lifetime. That's what makes it so amazing. You're like a giant sponge now, soaking things in. Facts, figures, general knowledge. And soon you'll begin to connect them, too. You'll see how different branches of learning are related. There are many levels, Charlie, like steps on a giant ladder that take you tip higher and higher to see more and more of the world around you.\" \"I can see only a little bit of that, Charlie, and I won't go much higher than I am now, but you'll keep climbing up and up, and see more and more, and each step will open new worlds that you never even knew existed.\" She frowned. \"I hope ... I just hope to God —\" \"What?\" \"Never mind, Charles. I just hope I wasn't wrong to advise you to go into this in the first place.\" I laughed. \"How could that be? It worked, didn't it? Even Algernon is still smart.\" We sat there silently for a while and I knew what she was thinking about as she watched me toying with the chain of my rabbit's foot and my keys. I didn't want to think of that possibility any more than elderly people want to think of death. I knew that this was only the beginning. I knew what she meant about levels because I'd seen some of them already. The thought of leaving her behind made me sad. I'm in love with Miss Kinnian. PROGRESS REPORT 11\nApril 30 I've quit my job with Donnegan's Plastic Box Company. Mr. Donnegan insisted it would be better for all concerned if I left. What did I do to make them hate me so? The first I knew of it was when Mr. Donnegan showed me the petition. Eight hundred names, everyone in the factory, except Fanny Girden. Scanning the list quickly, I saw at once that hers was the only missing name. All the rest demanded that I be fired. Joe Carp and Frank Reilly wouldn't talk to me about it. No one else would either, except Fanny. She was one of the few people I'd known who set her mind to something and believed it no matter what the rest of the world proved, said or did-and Fanny did not believe that I should have been fired. She had been against the petition on principle and despite the pressure and threats she'd held out. \"Which don't mean to say,\" she remarked, \"that I don't think there's something mighty strange about you, Charlie. Them chang es. I don't know. You used to be a good, dependable, ordinary man—not too bright maybe, but honest. Who knows what you done to yourself to get so smart all of a sudden. Like everybody around here's been saying, Charlie, it's not right.\" \"But how can you say that, Fanny? What's wrong with a man becoming intelligent and wanting to acquire knowledge and understanding of the world around him?\" She stared down at her work and I turned to leave. Without looking at me, she said: \"It was evil when Eve listened to the snake and ate from the tree of knowledge. It was evil when she saw that she was naked. If not for that none of us would ever have to grow old and sick, and die.\" Once again, now, I have the feeling of shame burning inside me. This intelligence has driven a wedge between me and all the people I once knew and loved. Before, they laughed at me and despised me for my ignorance and dullness; now, they hate me for my knowledge and understanding. What in God's name do they want of me? They've driven me out of the factory. Now I'm more alone than ever before. May 15 Dr. Strauss is very angry at me for not having written any progress reports in two weeks. He's justified because the lab is now paying me a regular salary. I told him I was too busy thinking and reading. When I pointed out that writing was such a slow process that it makes me impatient with my poor handwriting, he suggested I learn to type. It's much easier to write now because I can type seventy-five words a minute. Dr. Strauss continually reminds me of the need to speak and write simply so people will be able to understand me. I'll try to review all the things that happened to me during the last two weeks. Algernon and I were presented to the American Psychological Association sitting in convention with the World Psychological Association. We created quite a sensation. Dr. Nemur and Dr. Strauss were proud of us. I suspect that Dr. Nemur, who is sixty — ten years older than Dr. Strauss — finds it necessary to see tangible results of his work. Undoubtedly the result of pressure by Mrs. Nemur. Contrary to my earlier impressions of him, I realize that Dr. Nemur is not at all a genius. He has a very good mind, but it struggles tinder the spectre of self-doubt. He wants people to take him for a genius. Therefore, it is important for him to feel that his work is accepted by the world. I believe that Dr. Nemur was afraid of further delay because he worried that someone else might make a discovery along these lines and take the credit from him. Dr. Strauss on the other hand might be called a genius, although I feel that his areas of knowledge are too limited. He was educated in the tradition of narrow specialization; the broader aspects of background were neglected far more than necessary — even for a neurosurgeon. I was shocked to learn that the only ancient languages he could read were Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and that he knows almost nothing of mathematics beyond the elementary levels of the calcu- lus of variations. When he admitted this to me, I found myself almost annoyed. It was as if he'd hidden this part of himself in order to deceive me, pretending — as do many people I've discovered—to be what he is not. No one I've ever known is what he appears to be on the surface. Dr. Nemur appears to be uncomfortable around me. Sometimes when I try to talk to him, he just looks at me strangely and turns away. I was angry at first when Dr. Strauss told me I was giving Dr. Nemur an inferiority complex. I thought he was mocking me and I'm oversensitive at being made fun of. How was I to know that a highly respected psychoexperimen- talist like Nemur was unacquainted with Hindustani and Chinese? It's absurd when you consider the work that is being done in India and China today in the very field of his study. I asked Dr. Strauss how Nemur could refute Rahajamati's attack on his method and results if Nemur couldn't even read them in the first place. That strange look on Dr. Strauss' face can mean only one of two things. Either he doesn't want to tell Nemur what they're saying in India, or else — and this worries me — Dr. Strauss doesn't know either. I must be careful to speak and write clearly and simply so that people won't laugh. May 18 I am very disturbed. I saw Miss Kinnian last night for the first time in over a week. I tried to avoid all discussions of intellectual concepts and to keep the conversation on a simple, everyday level, but she just stared at me blankly and asked me what I meant about the mathematical variance equivalent in Dorbermann s Fifth Concerto. When I tried to explain she stopped me and laughed. I guess I got angry, but I suspect I'm approaching her on the wrong level. No matter what I try to discuss with her, I am unable to communicate. I must review Vrostadt's equations on Levels of Semantic Progression. I find that I don't communicate with people much any more. Thank God for books and music and things I can think about. I am alone in my apartment at Mrs. Flynn's boardinghouse most of the time and seldom speak to anyone. May 20 I would not have noticed the new dishwasher, a boy. of about sixteen, at the corner diner where I take my evening meals if not for the incident of the broken dishes. They crashed to the floor, shattering and sending bits of white china under the tables. The boy stood there, dazed and frightened, holding the empty tray in his hand. The whistles and catcalls from the customers (the cries of \"hey, there go the profits!\" \"Mazeltov!\". . . and \"well, he didn't work here very long which invariably seem to follow the breaking of glass or dishware in a public restaurant) all seemed to confuse him. When the owner came to see what the excitement was about, the boy cowered as if he expected to be struck and threw up his arms as if to ward off the blow. \"All right! All right, you dope,\" shouted the owner, \"don't just stand there! Get the broom and sweep that mess up. A broom... a broom, you idiot! It's in the kitchen. Sweep up all the pieces.\" The boy saw that he was not going to be punished. His frightened expression disappeared and he smiled and hummed as he came back with the broom to sweep the floor. A few of the rowdier customers kept up the remarks, amusing themselves at his expense. \"Here, sonny, over here there's a nice piece behind you....\" \"C'mon, do it again.\" \"He's not so dumb. It's easier to break'em than to wash'em...\" As his vacant eyes moved across the crowd of amused onlookers, he slowly mirrored their smiles and finally broke into an uncertain grin at the joke which he obviously did not understand. I felt sick inside as I looked at his dull, vacuous smile, the wide, bright eyes of a child, uncertain but eager to please. They were laughing at him because he was mentally retarded. And I had been laughing at him too. Suddenly, I was furious at myself and all those who were smirking at him. I jumped up and shouted, \"Shut up! Leave him alone! It's not his fault he can't understand. He can't help what lie is! But for God's sake... he's still a human being!\" The room grew silent. I cursed myself for losing control and creating a scene. I tried not to look at the boy as I paid my check and walked out without touching my food. I felt ashamed for both of us. How strange it is that people of honest feelings and sensibility, who would not take advantage of a man born without arms or legs or eyes—how such people think nothing of abusing a man born with low intelligence. It infuriated me to think that not too long ago, I like this boy, had foolishly played the clown. And I had almost forgotten. I'd hidden the picture of the old Charlie Gordon from myself because now that I was intelligent it was something that had to be pushed out of my mind. But today in looking at that boy, for the first time I saw what I had been. I was just like him! Only a short time ago, I learned that people laughed at me. Now I can see that unknowingly I joined with them in laughing at myself. That hurts most of all. I have often reread my progress reports and seen the illiteracy, the childish naivete, the mind of low intelligence peering from a dark room, through the keyhole, at the dazzling light outside. I see that even in my dullness I knew that I was inferior, and that other people had something I lacked-something denied me. In my mental blindness, I thought that it was somehow connected with the ability to read and write, and I was sure that if I could get those skills I would automatically have intelligence too. Even a feeble-minded man wants to be like other men. A child may not know how to feed itself, or what to eat, yet it knows of hunger. This then is what I was like, I never knew. Even with my gift of intellectual awareness, I never really knew. This day was good for me. Seeing the past more clearly, I have decided to use my knowledge and skills to work in the field of increasing human intelligence levels. Who is better equipped for this work? Who else has lived in both worlds? These are my people. Let me use my gift to do something for them. Tomorrow, I will discuss with Dr. Strauss the manner in which I can work in this area. I may be able to help him work out the problems of widespread use of the technique which was used on me. I have several good ideas of my own. There is so much that might be done with this technique. If I could be made into a genius, what about thousands of others like myself? What fantastic levels might be achieved by using this technique on normal people? Or geniuses? There are so many doors to open. I am impatient to begin. PROGRESS REPORT 12\nMay 23 It happened today. Algernon bit me. I visited the lab to see him as I do occasionally, and when I took him out of his cage, he snapped at my hand. I put him back and watched him for a while. He was unusually disturbed and vicious. May 24 Burt, who is in charge of the experimental animals, tells me that Algernon is changing. He is less co-operative; he refuses to run the maze any more; general motivation has decreased. And he hasn't been eating. Everyone is upset about what this may mean. May 25 They've been feeding Algernon, who now refuses to work the shifting-lock problem. Everyone identifies me with Algernon. in a way we're both the first of our kind. They're all pretending that Algernon's behavior is not necessarily significant for me. But it's hard to hide the fact that some of the other animals who were used in this experiment are showing strange behavior. Dr. Strauss and Dr. Nemur have asked me not to come to the lab any more. I know what they're thinking but I can't accept it. I am going ahead with my plans to carry their research forward. With all due respect to both of these fine scientists, l am well aware of their limitations. If there is an answer, I'll have to find it out for myself. Suddenly, time has become very important to me. May 29 I have been given a lab of my own and permission to go ahead with the research. I'm on to something. Working day and night. I've had a cot moved into the lab. Most of my writing time is spent on the notes which I keep in a separate folder, but from time to time I feel it necessary to put down my moods and my thoughts out of sheer habit. I find the calculus of intelligence to be a fascinating study. Here is the place for the application of all the knowledge I have acquired. In a sense it's the problem I've been concerned with all my life. May 31 Dr. Strauss thinks I'm working too hard. Dr. Nemur says I'm trying to cram a lifetime of research and thought into a few weeks. I know I should rest, but I'm driven on by something inside that won't let me stop. I've got to find the reason for the sharp regression in Algernon. I've got to know if and when it will happen to me. June 4 LETTER TO DR. STRAUSS (copy) Dear Dr. Strauss: Under separate cover I am sending you a copy of my report entitled, \"The Algernon-Gordon Effect: A Study of Structure and Function of Increased Intelligence,\" which I would like to have you read and have published. As you see, my experiments are completed. I have included in my report all of my formulae, as well as mathematical analysis in the appendix. Of course, these should be verified. Because of its importance to both you and Dr. Nemur (and need I say to myself, too?) I have checked and rechecked my results a dozen times in the hope of finding an error. I am sorry to say the results must stand. Yet for the sake of science, I am grateful for the little bit that I here add to the knowledge of the function of the human mind and of the laws governing the artificial increase of human intelligence. I recall your once saying to me that an experimental failure or the disproving of a theory was as important to the advancement of learning as a success would be. I know now that this is true. I am sorry, however, that my own contribution to the field must rest upon the ashes of the work of two men I regard so highly. Yours truly, Charles Gordon June 5 I must not become emotional. The facts and the results of my experiments are clear, and the more sensational aspects of my own rapid climb cannot obscure the fact that the tripling of intelligence by the surgical technique developed by Drs. Strauss and Nemur must be viewed as having little or no practical applicability (at the present time) to the increase of human intelligence. As I review the records and data on Algernon, I see that although he is still in his physical infancy, he has regressed mentally. Motor activity is impaired; there is a general reduction of glandular activity; there is an accelerated loss of co-ordination. There are also strong indications of progressive amnesia. As will be seen by my report, these and other physical and mental deterioration syndromes can be predicted with statistically significant results by the application of my formula. The surgical stimulus to which we were both subjected has resulted in an intensification and acceleration of all mental processes. The unforeseen development, which I have taken the liberty of calling the Algernon-Gordon Effect, is the logical extension of the entire intelligence speed-up. The hypothesis here proven may be described simply in the following terms: Artificially increased intelligence deteriorates at a rate of time directly proportional to the quantity of the increase. I feel that this, in itself, is an important discovery. As long as I am able to write, I will continue to record my thoughts in these progress reports. It is one of my few pleasures. However, by all indications, my own mental deterioration will be very rapid. I have already begun to notice signs of emotional instability and forgetfulness, the first symptoms of the burnout. June 10 Deterioration progressing. I have become absentminded. Algernon died two days ago. Dissection shows my predictions were right. His brain had decreased in weight and there was a general smoothing out of cerebral convolutions as well as a deepening and broadening of brain fissures. I guess the same thing is or will soon be happening to me. Now that it's definite, I don't want it to happen. I put Algernon's body in a cheese box and buried him in the back yard. I cried. June 15 Dr. Strauss came to see me again. I wouldn't open the door and I told him to go away. I want to be left to myself. I have become touchy and irritable. I feel the darkness closing in. It's hard to throw off thoughts of suicide. I keep telling myself how important this introspective journal will be. It's a strange sensation to pick up a book that you've read and enjoyed just a few months ago and discover that you don't remember it. I remembered how great I thought John Milton was, but when I picked up Paradise Lost I couldn't understand it at all. I got so angry I threw the book across the room. I've got to try to hold on to some of it. Some of the things I've learned. Oh, God, please don't take it all away. June 19 Sometimes, at night, I go out for a walk. Last night I couldn't remember where I lived. A policeman took me home. I have the strange feeling that this has all happened to me before — a long time ago. I keep telling myself I'm the only person in the world who can describe what's happening to me. June 21 Why can't I remember? I've got to fight. I lie in bed for days and I don't know who or where I am. Then it all comes back to me in a flash. Fugues of amnesia. Symptoms of senility—second childhood. I can watch them coming on. It's so cruelly logical. I learned so much and so fast. Now my mind is deteriorating rapidly. I won't let it happen. I'll fight it. I can't help thinking of the boy in the restaurant, the blank expression, the silly smile, the people laughing at him. No — please — not that again... June 22 I'm forgetting things that I learned recently. It seems to be following the classic pattern — the last things learned are the first things forgotten. Or is that the pattern? I'd better look it up again... I reread my paper on the Algemon-Gordon Effect and I get the strange feeling that it was written by someone else. There are parts I don't even understand. Motor activity impaired. I keep tripping over things, and it becomes increasingly difficult to type. June 23 I've given up using the typewriter completely. My coordination is bad. I feel that I'm moving slower and slower. Had a terrible shock today. I picked up a copy of an article I used in my research, Krueger's Uber Psychische Ganzheit, to see if it would help me understand what I had done. First I thought there was something wrong with my eyes. Then I realized I could no longer read German. I tested myself in other languages. All gone. June 30 A week since I dared to write again. It's slipping away like sand through my fingers. Most of the books I have are too hard for me now. I get angry with them because I know that I read and understood them just a few weeks ago. I keep telling myself I must keep writing these reports so that somebody will know what is happening to me. But it gets harder to form the words and remember spellings. I have to look up even simple words in the dictionary now and it makes me impatient with myself. Dr. Strauss comes around almost every day, but I told him I wouldn't see or speak to anybody. He feels guilty. They all do. But I don't blame anyone. I knew what might happen. But how it hurts. July 7 1 don't know where the week went. Todays Sunday I know because I can see through my window people going to church. I think I stayed in bed all week but I remember Mrs. Flynn bringing food to me a few times. I keep saying over and over Ive got to do something but then I forget or maybe its just easier not to do what I say Im going to do. I think of my mother and father a lot these days. I found a picture of them with me taken at a beach. My father has a big ball under his arm and my mother is holding me by the hand. I dont remember them the way they are in the picture. All I remember is my father drunk most of the time and arguing with mom about money. He never shaved much and he used to scratch my face when he hugged me. My mother said he died but Cousin Miltie said he heard his mom and dad say that my father ran away with another woman. When I asked my mother she slapped my face and said my father was dead. I don't think I ever found out which was true but I don't care much. (He said he was going to take me to see cows on a farm once but he never did. He never kept his promises...) July 10 My landlady Mrs Flynn is very worried about me. She says the way I lay around all day and dont do anything I remind her of her son before she threw him out of the house. She said she doesnt like loafers. If Im sick its one thing, but if Im a loafer thats another thing and she wont have it. I told her I think Im sick. I try to read a little bit every day, mostly stories, but sometimes I have to read the same thing over and over again because I dont know what it means. And its hard to write. I know I should look up all the words in the dictionary but its so hard and Im so tired all the time. Then I got the idea that I would only use the easy words instead of the long hard ones. That saves time. I put flowers on Algernons grave about once a week. Mrs Flynn thinks I'm crazy to put flowers on a mouses grave but I told her that Algernon was special. July 14 Its sunday again. I dont have anything to do to keep me busy now because my television set is broke and I dont have any money to get it fixed. (I think I lost this months check from the lab. I dont remember) I get awful headaches and asperin doesnt help me much. Mrs Flynn knows Im really sick and she feels very sorry for me. Shes a wonderful woman whenever someone is sick. July22 Mrs Flynn called a strange doctor to see me. She was afraid I was going to die. I told the doctor I wasnt too sick and that I only forget sometimes. He asked me did I have any friends or relatives and I said no I dont have any. I told him I had a friend called Algernon once but he was a mouse and we used to run races together. He looked at me kind of funny like he thought I was crazy. He smiled when I told him I used to be a genius. He talked to me like I was a baby and he winked at Mrs Flynn. I got mad and chased him out because he was making fun of me the way they all used to. July 24 I have no more money and Mrs. Flynn says I got to go to work somewhere and pay the rent because I havent paid for over two months. I dont know any work but the job I used to have at Donnegans Plastic Box Company. I dont want to go back there because they all knew me when I was smart and maybe theyll laugh at me. But I dont know what else to do to get money. July 25 I was looking at some of my old progress reports and its very funny but I cant read what I wrote. I can make out some of the words but they dont make sense. Miss Kinnian came to the door but I said go away I dont want to see you. She cried and I cried too but I wouldn't let her in because I didn't want her to laugh at me. I told her I didn't like her any more. I told her I didn't want to be smart any more. Thats not true. I still love her and I still want to be smart but I had to say that so shed go away. She gave Mrs Flynn money to pay the rent. I dont want that. I got to get a job. Please... please let me not forget how to read and write. . July 27 Mr Donnegan was very nice when I came back and asked him for my old job of janitor. First he was very suspicious but I told him what happened to me then he looked very sad and put his hand on my shoulder and said Charlie Gordon you got guts. Everybody looked at me when I came downstairs and started working in the toilet sweeping it out like I used to. I told myself Charlie if they make fun of you dont get sore because you remember their not so smart as you once thot they were. And besides they were once your friends and if they laughed at you that doesnt mean anything because they liked you too. One of the new men who came to work there after I went away made a nasty crack he said hey Charlie I hear your a very smart fella a real quiz kid. Say something intelligent. I felt bad but Joe Carp came over and grabbed him by the shirt and said leave him alone you lousy cracker or Ill break your neck. I didnt expect Joe to take my part so I guess hes really my friend. Later Frank Reilly came over and said Charlie if anybody bothers you or trys to take advantage you call me or Joe and we will set em straight. I said thanks Frank and I got choked up so I had to turn around and go into the supply room so he wouldnt see me cry. Its good to have friends. July 28 I did a dumb thing today I forgot I wasnt in Miss Kinnians class at the adult center any more like I used to be. I went in and sat down in my old seat in the back of the room and she looked at me funny and she said Charles. I dint remember she ever called me that before only Charlie so I said hello Miss Kinnian Im redy for my lesin today only I lost my reader that we was using. She startid to cry and run out of the room and everybody looked at me and I saw they wasnt the same pepul who used to be in my class. Then all of a sudden I remembered some things about the operashun and me getting smart and I said holy smoke I reely pulled a Charlie Gordon that time. I went away before she come back to the room. Thats why Im going away from New York for good. I dont want to do nothing like that agen. I dont want Miss Kinnian to feel sorry for me. Evry body feels sorry at the factery and I dont want that eather so Im going someplace where nobody knows that Charlie Gordon was once a genus and now he cant even reed a book or rite good. Im taking a cuple of books along and even if I cant reed them Ill practise hard and maybe I wont forget every thing I lerned. If I try reel hard maybe Ill be a littel bit smarter than I was before the operashun. I got my rabits foot and my luky penny and may'be they will help me. If you ever reed this Miss Kinnian dont be sorry for me Im glad I got a second chanse to be smart becaus I lerned a lot of things that I never even new were in this world and Im grateful that I saw it all for a little bit. I dont know why Im dumb agen or what I did wrong maybe its becaus I dint try hard enuff. But if I try and practis very hard maybe Ill get a little smarter and know what all the words are. I remember a littel bit how nice I had a feeling with the blue book that has the torn cover when I red it. Thats why Im gonna keep trying to get smart so I can have that feeling agen. Its a good feeling to know things and be smart. I wish I had it rite now if I did I would sit down and reed all the time. Anyway I bet Im the first dumb person in the world who ever found out something importent for sience. I remember I did something but I dont remember what. So I gess its like I did it for all the dumb pepul like me. Good-by Miss Kinnian and Dr Strauss and evreybody. And P.S. please tell Dr Nemur not to be such a grouch when pepul laff at him and he would have more frends. Its easy to make frends if you let pepul laff at you. Im going to have lots of frends where I go. P.P.S. Please if you get a chanse put some flowrs on Algernons grave in the bak yard....

This is the most important moment in our lives, and I want to pay attention, note every detail. Your dad and I have just come back from an evening out, dinner and a show; it's after midnight. We came out onto the patio to look at the full moon; then I told your dad I wanted to dance, so he humors me and now we're slow-dancing, a pair of thirtysomethings swaying back and forth in the moon-light like kids. I don't feel the night chill at all. And then your dad says, \"Do you want to make a baby?\"\nRight now your dad and I have been married for about two years, living on Ellis Avenue; when we move out you'll still be too young to remember the house, but we'll show you pictures of it, tell you stories about it. I'd love to tell you the story of this evening, the night you're conceived, but the right time to do that would be when you're ready to have children of your own, and we'll never get that chance.\nTelling it to you any earlier wouldn't do any good; for most of your life you won't sit still to hear such a romantic— you'd say sappy—story. I remember the scenario of your origin you'll suggest when you're twelve.\n\"The only reason you had me was so you could get a maid you wouldn't have to pay,\" you'll say bitterly, dragging the vacuum cleaner out of the closet.\n\"That's right,\" I'll say. \"Thirteen years ago I knew the carpets would need vacuuming around now, and having a baby seemed to be the cheapest and easiest way to get the job done. Now kindly get on with it.\"\n\"If you weren't my mother, this would be illegal,\" you'll say, seething as you unwind the power cord and plug it into the wall outlet.\nThat will be in the house on Belmont Street. I'll live to see strangers occupy both houses: the one you're conceived in and the one you grow up in. Your dad and I will sell the first a couple years after your arrival. I'll sell the second shortly after your departure. By then Nelson and I will have moved into our farmhouse, and your dad will be living with what's-her-name.\nI know how this story ends; I think about it a lot. I also think a lot about how it began, just a few years ago, when ships appeared in orbit and artifacts appeared in meadows. The government said next to nothing about them, while the tabloids said every possible thing.\nAnd then I got a phone call, a request for a meeting.\nI spotted them waiting in the hallway, outside my office. They made an odd couple; one wore a military uniform and a crew cut, and carried an aluminum briefcase. He seemed to be assessing his surroundings with a critical eye. The other one was easily identifiable as an academic: full beard and mustache, wearing corduroy. He was browsing through the overlapping sheets stapled to a bulletin board nearby.\n\"Colonel Weber, I presume?\" I shook hands with the soldier. \"Louise Banks.\"\n\"Dr. Banks. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us,\" he said.\n\"Not at all; any excuse to avoid the faculty meeting.\" Colonel Weber indicated his companion. \"This is Dr. Gary Donnelly, the physicist I mentioned when we spoke on the phone.\"\n\"Call me Gary,\" he said as we shook hands. \"I'm anxious to hear what you have to say.\"\nWe entered my office. I moved a couple of stacks of books off the second guest chair, and we all sat down. \"You said you wanted me to listen to a recording. I presume this has something to do with the aliens?\"\n\"All I can offer is the recording,\" said Colonel Weber.\n\"Okay, let's hear it.\"\nColonel Weber took a tape machine out of his briefcase and pressed PLAY. The recording sounded vaguely like that of a wet dog shaking the water out of its fur.\n\"What do you make of that?\" he asked. I withheld my comparison to a wet dog. \"What was the context in which this recording was made?\"\n\"I'm not at liberty to say.\"\n\"It would help me interpret those sounds. Could you see the alien while it was speaking? Was it doing anything at the time?\"\n\"The recording is all I can offer.\"\n\"You won't be giving anything away if you tell me that you've seen the aliens; the public's assumed you have.\"\nColonel Weber wasn't budging. \"Do you have any opinion about its linguistic properties?\" he asked.\n\"Well, it's clear that their vocal tract is substantially different from a human vocal tract. I assume that these aliens don't look like humans?\"\nThe colonel was about to say something noncommittal when Gary Donnelly asked, \"Can you make any guesses based on the tape?\"\n\"Not really. It doesn't sound like they're using a larynx to make those sounds, but that doesn't tell me what they look like.\"\n\"Anything—is there anything else you can tell us?\" asked Colonel Weber.\nI could see he wasn't accustomed to consulting a civilian. \"Only that establishing communications is going to be really difficult because of the difference in anatomy. They're almost certainly using sounds that the human vocal tract can't reproduce, and maybe sounds that the human ear can't distinguish.\"\n\"You mean infra- or ultrasonic frequencies?\" asked Gary Donnelly.\n\"Not specifically. I just mean that the human auditory system isn't an absolute acoustic instrument; It's optimized to recognize the sounds that a human larynx makes. With an alien vocal system, all bets are off.\" I shrugged. \"Maybe we'll be able to hear the difference between alien phonemes, given enough practice, but it's possible our ears simply can't recognize the distinctions they consider meaningful. In that case we'd need a sound spectrograph to know what an alien is saying.\"\nColonel Weber asked, \"Suppose I gave you an hour's worth of recordings; how long would it take you to determine if we need this sound spectrograph or not?\"\n\"I couldn't determine that with just a recording no matter how much time I had. I'd need to talk with the aliens directly.\"\nThe colonel shook his head. \"Not possible.\"\nI tried to break it to him gently. \"That's your call, of course. But the only way to learn an unknown language is to interact with a native speaker, and by that I mean asking questions, holding a conversation, that sort of thing. Without that, it's simply not possible. So if you want to learn the aliens' language, someone with training in field linguistics— whether it's me or someone else—will have to talk with an alien. Recordings alone aren't sufficient.\"\nColonel Weber owned. \"You seem to be implying that no alien could have learned human languages by monitoring our broadcasts.\"\n\"I doubt it. They'd need instructional material specifically designed to teach human languages to non-humans. Either that, or interaction with a human. If they had either of those, they could learn a lot from TV, but otherwise, they wouldn't have a starting point.\"\nThe colonel clearly found this interesting; evidently his philosophy was, the less the aliens knew, the better. Gary Donnelly read the colonel's expression too and rolled his eyes. I suppressed a smile.\nThen Colonel Weber asked, \"Suppose you were learning a new language by talking to its speakers; could you do it without teaching them English?\"\n\"That would depend on how cooperative the native speakers were. They'd almost certainly pick up bits and pieces while I'm learning their language, but it wouldn't have to be much if they're willing to teach. On the other hand, if they'd rather learn English than teach us their language, that would make things far more difficult.\"\nThe colonel nodded. \"I'll get back to you on this matter.\"\nThe request for that meeting was perhaps the second most momentous phone call in my life. The first, of course, will be the one from Mountain Rescue. At that point your dad and I will be speaking to each other maybe once a year, tops. After I get that phone call, though, the first thing I'll do will be to call your father.\nHe and I will drive out together to perform the identification, a long silent car ride. I remember the morgue, all tile and stainless steel, the hum of refrigeration and smell of antiseptic. An orderly will pull the sheet back to reveal your face. Your face will look wrong somehow, but I'll know it's you.\n\"Yes, that's her,\" I'll say. \"She's mine.\"\nYou'll be twenty-five then.\nThe MP checked my badge, made a notation on his clipboard, and opened the gate; I drove the off-road vehicle into the encampment, a small village of tents pitched by the Army in a farmer's sun-scorched pasture. At the center of the encampment was one of the alien devices, nicknamed \"looking glasses.\"\nAccording to the briefings I'd attended, there were nine of these in the United States, one hundred and twelve in the world. The looking glasses acted as two-way communication devices, presumably with the ships in orbit. No one knew why the aliens wouldn't talk to us in person; fear of cooties, maybe. A team of scientists, including a physicist and a linguist, was assigned to each looking glass; Gary Donnelly and I were on this one.\nGary was waiting for me in the parking area. We navigated a circular maze of concrete barricades until we reached the large tent that covered the looking glass itself. In front of the tent was an equipment cart loaded with goodies borrowed from the school's phonology lab; I had sent it ahead for inspection by the Army.\nAlso outside the tent were three tripod-mounted video cameras whose lenses peered, through windows in the fabric wall, into the main room. Everything Gary and I did would be reviewed by countless others, including military intelligence. In addition we would each send daily reports, of which mine had to include estimates on how much English I thought the aliens could understand.\nGary held open the tent flap and gestured for me to enter. \"Step right up,\" he said, circus-barker-style. \"Marvel at creatures the likes of which have never been seen on God's green earth.\"\n\"And all for one slim dime,\" I murmured, walking through the door. At the moment the looking glass was inactive, resembling a semicircular mirror over ten feet high and twenty feet across. On the brown grass in front of the looking glass, an arc of white spray paint outlined the activation area. Currently the area contained only a table, two folding chairs, and a power strip with a cord leading to a generator outside. The buzz of fluorescent lamps, hung from poles along the edge of the room, commingled with the buzz of flies in the sweltering heat.\nGary and I looked at each other, and then began pushing the cart of equipment up to the table. As we crossed the paint line, the looking glass appeared to grow transparent; it was as if someone was slowly raising the illumination behind tinted glass. The illusion of depth was uncanny; I felt I could walk right into it. Once the looking glass was fully lit it resembled a life-sized diorama of a semicircular room. The room contained a few large objects that might have been furniture, but no aliens. There was a door in the curved rear wall.\nWe busied ourselves connecting everything together: microphone, sound spectrograph, portable computer, and speaker. As we worked, I frequently glanced at the looking glass, anticipating the aliens' arrival. Even so I jumped when one of them entered.\nIt looked like a barrel suspended at the intersection of seven limbs. It was radially symmetric, and any of its limbs could serve as an arm or a leg. The one in front of me was walking around on four legs, three non-adjacent arms curled up at its sides. Gary called them \"heptapods.\"\nI'd been shown videotapes, but I still gawked. Its limbs had no distinct joints; anatomists guessed they might be supported by vertebral columns. Whatever their underlying structure, the heptapod's limbs conspired to move it in a disconcertingly fluid manner. Its \"torso\" rode atop the rippling limbs as smoothly as a hovercraft. Seven lidless eyes ringed the top of the heptapod's body. It walked back to the doorway from which it entered, made a brief sputtering sound, and returned to the center of the room followed by another heptapod; at no point did it ever turn around. Eerie, but logical; with eyes on all sides, any direction might as well be \"forward.\"\nGary had been watching my reaction. \"Ready?\" he asked.\nI took a deep breath. \"Ready enough.\" I'd done plenty of fieldwork before, in the Amazon, but it had always been a bilingual procedure: either my informants knew some Portuguese, which I could use, or I'd previously gotten an introduction to their language from the local missionaries. This would be my first attempt at conducting a true monolingual discovery procedure. It was straightforward enough in theory, though.\nI walked up to the looking glass and a heptapod on the other side did the same. The image was so real that my skin crawled. I could see the texture of its gray skin, like corduroy ridges arranged in whorls and loops. There was no smell at all from the looking glass, which somehow made the situation stranger.\nI pointed to myself and said slowly, \"Human.\" Then I pointed to Gary. \"Human.\"\nThen I pointed at each heptapod and said, \"What are you?\"\nNo reaction. I tried again, and then again.\nOne of the heptapods pointed to itself with one limb, the four terminal digits pressed together. That was lucky. In some cultures a person pointed with his chin; if the heptapod hadn't used one of its limbs, I wouldn't have known what gesture to look for. I heard a brief fluttering sound, and saw a puckered orifice at the top of its body vibrate; it was talking. Then it pointed to its companion and fluttered again.\nI went back to my computer; on its screen were two virtually identical spectrographs representing the fluttering sounds. I marked a sample for playback. I pointed to myself and said \"Human\" again, and did the same with Gary. Then I pointed to the heptapod, and played back the flutter on the speaker.\nThe heptapod fluttered some more. The second half of the spectrograph for this utterance looked like a repetition: call the previous utterances [flutter1], then this one was [flutter2flutter1].\nI pointed at something that might have been a heptapod chair. \"What is that?\"\nThe heptapod paused, and then pointed at the \"chair\" and talked some more. The spectrograph for this differed distinctly from that of the earlier sounds: [flutter3]. Once again, I pointed to the \"chair\" while playing back [flutter3].\nThe heptapod replied; judging by the spectrograph, it looked like [flutter3flutter2].\nOptimistic interpretation: the heptapod was confirming my utterances as correct, which implied compatibility between heptapod and human patterns of discourse. Pessimistic interpretation: it had a nagging cough. At my computer I delimited certain sections of the spectrograph and typed in a tentative gloss for each: \"heptapod\" for [flutter1], \"yes\" for [flutter2], and \"chair\" for [flutter3]. Then I typed \"Language: Heptapod A\" as a heading for all the utterances.\nGary watched what I was typing. \"What's the 'A' for?\"\n\"It just distinguishes this language from any other ones the heptapods might use,\" I said. He nodded.\n\"Now let's try something, just for laughs.\" I pointed at each heptapod and tried to mimic the sound of [flutter1], \"heptapod.\" After a long pause, the first heptapod said something and then the second one said something else, neither of whose spectrographs resembled anything said before. I couldn't tell if they were speaking to each other or to me since they had no faces to turn. I tried pronouncing [flutter1] again, but there was no reaction.\n\"Not even close,\" I grumbled.\n\"I'm impressed you can make sounds like that at all,\" said Gary.\n\"You should hear my moose call. Sends them running.\"\nI tried again a few more times, but neither heptapod responded with anything I could recognize. Only when I replayed the recording of the heptapod's pronunciation did I get a confirmation; the heptapod replied with [flutter2], \"yes.\"\n\"So we're stuck with using recordings?\" asked Gary.\nI nodded. \"At least temporarily.\"\n\"So now what?\"\n\"Now we make sure it hasn't actually been saying 'aren't they cute' or 'look what they're doing now.' Then we see if we can identify any of these words when that other heptapod pronounces them.\" I gestured for him to have a seat. \"Get comfortable; this'll take a while.\"\nIn 1770, Captain Cook's ship Endeavour ran aground on the coast of Queensland, Australia. While some of his men made repairs, Cook led an exploration party and met the aboriginal people. One of the sailors pointed to the animals that hopped around with their young riding in pouches, and asked an aborigine what they were called. The aborigine replied, \"Kanguru.\" From then on Cook and his sailors referred to the animals by this word. It wasn't until later that they learned it meant \"What did you say?\"\nI tell that story in my introductory course every year. It's almost certainly untrue, and I explain that afterwards, but it's a classic anecdote. Of course, the anecdotes my undergraduates will really want to hear are ones featuring the heptapods; for the rest of my teaching career, that'll be the reason many of them sign up for my courses. So I'll show them the old videotapes of my sessions at the looking glass, and the sessions that the other linguists conducted; the tapes are instructive, and they'll be useful if we're ever visited by aliens again, but they don't generate many good anecdotes.\nWhen it comes to language-learning anecdotes, my favorite source is child language acquisition. I remember one afternoon when you are five years old, after you have come home from kindergarten. You'll be coloring with your crayons while I grade papers.\n\"Mom,\" you'll say, using the carefully casual tone reserved for requesting a favor, \"can I ask you something?\"\n\"Sure, sweetie. Go ahead.\"\n\"Can I be, um, honored?\"\nI'll look up from the paper I'm grading. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"At school Sharon said she got to be honored.\"\n\"Really? Did she tell you what for?\"\n\"It was when her big sister got married. She said only one person could be, um, honored, and she was it.\"\n\"Ah, I see. You mean Sharon was maid of honor?\"\n\"Yeah, that's it. Can I be made of honor?\"\nGary and I entered the prefab building containing the center of operations for the looking glass site. Inside it looked like they were planning an invasion, or perhaps an evacuation: crew-cut soldiers worked around a large map of the area, or sat in front of burly electronic gear while speaking into headsets. We were shown into Colonel Weber's office, a room in the back that was cool from air conditioning.\nWe briefed the colonel on our first day's results. \"Doesn't sound like you got very far,\" he said.\n\"I have an idea as to how we can make faster progress,\" I said. \"But you'll have to approve the use of more equipment.\"\n\"What more do you need?\"\n\"A digital camera, and a big video screen.\" I showed him a drawing of the setup I imagined. \"I want to try conducting the discovery procedure using writing; I'd display words on the screen, and use the camera to record the words they write. I'm hoping the heptapods will do the same.\"\nWeber looked at the drawing dubiously. \"What would be the advantage of that?\"\n\"So far I've been proceeding the way I would with speakers of an unwritten language. Then it occurred to me that the heptapods must have writing, too.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"If the heptapods have a mechanical way of producing writing, then their writing ought to be very regular, very consistent. That would make it easier for us to identify graphemes instead of phonemes. It's like picking out the letters in a printed sentence instead of trying to hear them when the sentence is spoken aloud.\"\n\"I take your point,\" he admitted. \"And how would you respond to them? Show them the words they displayed to you?\"\n\"Basically. And if they put spaces between words, any sentences we write would be a lot more intelligible than any spoken sentence we might splice together from recordings.\"\nHe leaned back in his chair. \"You know we want to show as little of our technology as possible.\"\n\"I understand, but we're using machines as intermediaries already. If we can get them to use writing, I believe progress will go much faster than if we're restricted to the sound spectrographs.\"\nThe colonel turned to Gary. \"Your opinion?\"\n\"It sounds like a good idea to me. I'm curious whether the heptapods might have difficulty reading our monitors. Their looking glasses are based on a completely different technology than our video screens. As far as we can tell, they don't use pixels or scan lines, and they don't refresh on a frame-by-frame basis.\"\n\"You think the scan lines on our video screens might render them unreadable to the heptapods?\"\n\"It's possible,\" said Gary. \"We'll just have to try it and see.\"\nWeber considered it. For me it wasn't even a question, but from his point of view it was a difficult one; like a soldier, though, he made it quickly. \"Request granted. Talk to the sergeant outside about bringing in what you need. Have it ready for tomorrow.\"\nI remember one day during the summer when you're sixteen. For once, the person waiting for her date to arrive is me. Of course, you'll be waiting around too, curious to see what he looks like. You'll have a friend of yours, a blond girl with the unlikely name of Roxie, hanging out with you, giggling.\n\"You may feel the urge to make comments about him,\" I'll say, checking myself in the hallway mirror. \"Just restrain yourselves until we leave.\"\n\"Don't worry, Mom,\" you'll say. \"We'll do it so that he won't know. Roxie, you ask me what I think the weather will be like tonight. Then I'll say what I think of Mom's date.\"\n\"Right,\" Roxie will say.\n\"No, you most definitely will not,\" I'll say.\n\"Relax, Mom. He'll never know; we do this all the time.\"\n\"What a comfort that is.\"\nA little later on, Nelson will arrive to pick me up. I'll do the introductions, and we'll all engage in a little small talk on the front porch. Nelson is ruggedly handsome, to your evident approval. Just as we're about to leave, Roxie will say to you casually,\n\"So what do you think the weather will be like tonight?\"\n\"I think it's going to be really hot,\" you'll answer. Roxie will nod in agreement. Nelson will say, \"Really? I thought they said it was going to be cool.\"\n\"I have a sixth sense about these things,\" you'll say. Your face will give nothing away.\n\"I get the feeling it's going to be a scorcher. Good thing you're dressed for it, Mom.\"\nI'll glare at you, and say good night. As I lead Nelson toward his car, he'll ask me, amused, \"I'm missing something here, aren't I?\"\n\"A private joke,\" I'll mutter. \"Don't ask me to explain it.\"\nAt our next session at the looking glass, we repeated the procedure we had performed before, this time displaying a printed word on our computer screen at the same time we spoke: showing HUMAN while saying \"Human,\" and so forth. Eventually, the heptapods understood what we wanted, and set up a flat circular screen mounted on a small pedestal. One heptapod spoke, and then inserted a limb into a large socket in the pedestal; a doodle of script, vaguely cursive, popped onto the screen.\nWe soon settled into a routine, and I compiled two parallel corpora: one of spoken utterances, one of writing samples. Based on first impressions, their writing appeared to be logographic, which was disappointing; I'd been hoping for an alphabetic script to help us learn their speech. Their logograms might include some phonetic information, but finding it would be a lot harder than with an alphabetic script.\nBy getting up close to the looking glass, I was able to point to various heptapod body parts, such as limbs, digits, and eyes, and elicit terms for each. It turned out that they had an orifice on the underside of their body, lined with articulated bony ridges: probably used for eating, while the one at the top was for respiration and speech. There were no other conspicuous orifices; perhaps their mouth was their anus too. Those sorts of questions would have to wait.\nI also tried asking our two informants for terms for addressing each individually; personal names, if they had such things. Their answers were of course unpronounceable, so for Gary's and my purposes, I dubbed them Flapper and Raspberry. I hoped I'd be able to tell them apart.\nThe next day I conferred with Gary before we entered the looking-glass tent. \"I'll need your help with this session,\" I told him.\n\"Sure. What do you want me to do?\"\n\"We need to elicit some verbs, and it's easiest with third-person forms. Would you act out a few verbs while I type the written form on the computer? If we're lucky, the heptapods will figure out what we're doing and do the same. I've brought a bunch of props for you to use.\"\n\"No problem,\" said Gary, cracking his knuckles. \"Ready when you are.\"\nWe began with some simple intransitive verbs: walking, jumping, speaking, writing. Gary demonstrated each one with a charming lack of self-consciousness; the presence of the video cameras didn't inhibit him at all. For the first few actions he performed, I asked the heptapods,\"What do you call that?\" Before long, the heptapods caught on to what we were trying to do; Raspberry began mimicking Gary, or at least performing the equivalent heptapod action, while Flapper worked their computer, displaying a written description and pronouncing it aloud.\nIn the spectrographs of their spoken utterances, I could recognize their word I had glossed as \"heptapod.\" The rest of each utterance was presumably the verb phrase; it looked like they had analogs of nouns and verbs, thank goodness.\nIn their writing, however, things weren't as clearcut. For each action, they had displayed a single logogram instead of two separate ones. At first I thought they had written something like \"walks,\" with the subject implied. But why would Flapper say \"the heptapod walks\" while writing \"walks,\" instead of maintaining parallelism? Then I noticed that some of the logograms looked like the logogram for \"heptapod\" with some extra strokes added to one side or another. Perhaps their verbs could be written as affixes to a noun. If so, why was Flapper writing the noun in some instances but not in others?\nI decided to try a transitive verb; substituting object words might clarify things. Among the props I'd brought were an apple and a slice of bread. \"Okay,\" I said to Gary, \"show them the food, and then eat some. First the apple, then the bread.\"\nGary pointed at the Golden Delicious and then he took a bite out of it, while I displayed the \"what do you call that?\" expression. Then we repeated it with the slice of whole wheat.\nRaspberry left the room and returned with some kind of giant nut or gourd and a gelatinous ellipsoid. Raspberry pointed at the gourd while Flapper said a word and displayed a logogram. Then Raspberry brought the gourd down between its legs, a crunching sound resulted, and the gourd reemerged minus a bite; there were cornlike kernels beneath the shell. Flapper talked and displayed a large logogram on their screen. The sound spectrograph for \"gourd\" changed when it was used in the sentence; possibly a case marker. The logogram was odd: after some study, I could identify graphic elements that resembled the individual logograms for \"heptapod\" and \"gourd.\"\nThey looked as if they had been melted together, with several extra strokes in the mix that presumably meant \"eat.\" Was it a multiword ligature?\nNext we got spoken and written names for the gelatin egg, and descriptions of the act of eating it. The sound spectrograph for \"heptapod eats gelatin egg\" was analyzable; \"gelatin egg\" bore a case marker, as expected, though the sentence's word order differed from last time. The written form, another large logogram, was another matter. This time it took much longer for me to recognize anything in it; not only were the individual logograms melted together again, it looked as if the one for \"heptapod\" was laid on its back, while on top of it the logogram for \"gelatin egg\" was standing on its head.\n\"Uh-oh.\" I took another look at the writing for the simple noun-verb examples, the ones that had seemed inconsistent before. Now I realized all of them actually did contain the logogram for \"heptapod\" some were rotated and distorted by being combined with the various verbs, so I hadn't recognized them at first. \"You guys have got to be kidding,\" I muttered.\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Gary.\n\"Their script isn't word-divided; a sentence is written by joining the logograms for the constituent words. They join the logograms by rotating and modifying them. Take a look.\" I showed him how the logograms were rotated.\n\"So they can read a word with equal ease no matter how it's rotated,\" Gary said. He turned to look at the heptapods, impressed. \"I wonder if it's a consequence of their bodies' radial symmetry: their bodies have no 'forward' direction, so maybe their writing doesn't either. Highly neat.\"\nI couldn't believe it; I was working with someone who modified the word \"neat\" with \"highly.\" \"It certainly is interesting,\" I said, \"but it also means there's no easy way for us to write our own sentences in their language. We can't simply cut their sentences into individual words and recombine them; we'll have to learn the rules of their script before we can write anything legible. It's the same continuity problem we'd have had splicing together speech fragments, except applied to writing.\"\nI looked at Flapper and Raspberry in the looking glass, who were waiting for us to continue, and sighed. \"You aren't going to make this easy for us, are you?\"\nTo be fair, the heptapods were completely cooperative. In the days that followed, they readily taught us their language without requiring us to teach them any more English. Colonel Weber and his cohorts pondered the implications of that, while I and the linguists at the other looking glasses met via video conferencing to share what we had learned about the heptapod language. The videoconferencing made for an incongruous working environment: our video screens were primitive compared to the heptapods' looking glasses, so that my colleagues seemed more remote than the aliens. The familiar was far away, while the bizarre was close at hand.\nIt would be a while before we'd be ready to ask the heptapods why they had come, or to discuss physics well enough to ask them about their technology. For the time being, we worked on the basics: phonemics/graphemics, vocabulary, syntax. The heptapods at every looking glass were using the same language, so we were able to pool our data and coordinate our efforts.\nOur biggest source of confusion was the heptapods' \"writing.\" It didn't appear to be writing at all; it looked more like a bunch of intricate graphic designs. The logograms weren't arranged in rows, or a spiral, or any linear fashion. Instead, Flapper or Raspberry would write a sentence by sticking together as many logograms as needed into a giant conglomeration.\nThis form of writing was reminiscent of primitive sign systems, which required a reader to know a message's context in order to understand it. Such systems were considered too limited for systematic recording of information. Yet it was unlikely that the heptapods developed their level of technology with only an oral tradition. That implied one of three possibilities: the first was that the heptapods had a true writing system, but they didn't want to use it in front of us; Colonel Weber would identify with that one. The second was that the heptapods hadn't originated the technology they were using; they were illiterates using someone else's technology. The third, and most interesting to me, was that the heptapods were using a nonlinear system of orthography that qualified as true writing.\nI remember a conversation we'll have when you're in your junior year of high school. It'll be Sunday morning, and I'll be scrambling some eggs while you set the table for brunch. You'll laugh as you tell me about the party you went to last night.\n\"Oh man,\" you'll say, \"they're not kidding when they say that body weight makes a difference. I didn't drink any more than the guys did, but I got so much drunker.\"\nI'll try to maintain a neutral, pleasant expression. I'll really try. Then you'll say, \"Oh, come on, Mom.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"You know you did the exact same things when you were my age.\"\nI did nothing of the sort, but I know that if I were to admit that, you'd lose respect for me completely. \"You know never to drive, or get into a car if—\"\n\"God, of course I know that. Do you think I'm an idiot?\"\n\"No, of course not.\"\nWhat I'll think is that you are clearly, maddeningly not me. It will remind me, again, that you won't be a clone of me; you can be wonderful, a daily delight, but you won't be someone I could have created by myself.\nThe military had set up a trailer containing our offices at the looking glass site. I saw Gary walking toward the trailer, and ran to catch up with him. \"It's a semasiographic writing system,\" I said when I reached him.\n\"Excuse me?\" said Gary.\n\"Here, let me show you.\" I directed Gary into my office. Once we were inside, I went to the chalkboard and drew a circle with a diagonal line bisecting it. \"What does this mean?\"\n\"'Not allowed'?\"\n\"Right.\" Next I printed the words NOT ALLOWED on the chalkboard. \"And so does this. But only one is a representation of speech.\"\nGary nodded. \"Okay.\"\n\"Linguists describe writing like this—\" I indicated the printed words \"—as 'glottographic,' because it represents speech. Every human written language is in this category. However, this symbol—\" I indicated the circle and diagonal line \"—is 'semasiographic' writing, because it conveys meaning without reference to speech. There's no correspondence between its components and any particular sounds.\"\n\"And you think all of heptapod writing is like this?\"\n\"From what I've seen so far, yes. It's not picture writing, it's far more complex. It has its own system of rules for constructing sentences, like a visual syntax that's unrelated to the syntax for their spoken language.\"\n\"A visual syntax? Can you show me an example?\"\n\"Coming right up.\" I sat down at my desk and, using the computer, pulled up a frame from the recording of yesterday's conversation with Raspberry. I turned the monitor so he could see it. \"In their spoken language, a noun has a case marker indicating whether it's a subject or object. In their written language, however, a noun is identified as subject or object based on the orientation of its logogram relative to that of the verb. Here, take a look.\" I pointed at one of the figures. \"For instance, when 'heptapod' is integrated with 'hears' this way, with these strokes parallel, it means that the heptapod is doing the hearing.\" I showed him a different one. \"When they're combined this way, with the strokes perpendicular, it means that the heptapod is being heard. This morphology applies to several verbs.\n\"Another example is the inflection system.\" I called up another frame from the recording. \"In their written language, this logogram means roughly 'hear easily' or 'hear clearly.' See the elements it has in common with the logogram for 'hear'? You can still combine it with 'heptapod' in the same ways as before, to indicate that the heptapod can hear something clearly or that the heptapod is clearly heard. But what's really interesting is that the modulation of 'hear' into 'hear clearly' isn't a special case; you see the transformation they applied?\"\nGary nodded, pointing. \"It's like they express the idea of 'clearly' by changing the curve of those strokes in the middle.\"\n\"Right. That modulation is applicable to lots of verbs. The logogram for 'see' can be modulated in the same way to form 'see clearly,' and so can the logogram for 'read' and others. And changing the curve of those strokes has no parallel in their speech; with the spoken version of these verbs, they add a prefix to the verb to express ease of manner, and the prefixes for 'see' and 'hear' are different.\n\"There are other examples, but you get the idea. It's essentially a grammar in two dimensions.\"\nHe began pacing thoughtfully. \"Is there anything like this in human writing systems?\"\n\"Mathematical equations, notations for music and dance. But those are all very specialized; we couldn't record this conversation using them. But I suspect, if we knew it well enough, we could record this conversation in the heptapod writing system. I think it's a full-fledged, general-purpose graphical language.\"\nGary owned. \"So their writing constitutes a completely separate language from their speech, right?\"\n\"Right. In fact, it'd be more accurate to refer to the writing system as 'Heptapod B,' and use 'Heptapod A' strictly for referring to the spoken language.\"\n\"Hold on a second. Why use two languages when one would suffice? That seems unnecessarily hard to learn.\"\n\"Like English spelling?\" I said. \"Ease of learning isn't the primary force in language evolution. For the heptapods, writing and speech may play such different cultural or cognitive roles that using separate languages makes more sense than using different forms of the same one.\"\nHe considered it. \"I see what you mean. Maybe they think our form of writing is redundant, like we're wasting a second communications channel.\"\n\"That's entirely possible. Finding out why they use a second language for writing will tell us a lot about them.\"\n\"So I take it this means we won't be able to use their writing to help us learn their spoken language.\"\nI sighed. \"Yeah, that's the most immediate implication. But I don't think we should ignore either Heptapod A or B; we need a two-pronged approach.\" I pointed at the screen. \"I'll bet you that learning their two-dimensional grammar will help you when it comes time to learn their mathematical notation.\"\n\"You've got a point there. So are we ready to start asking about their mathematics?\"\n\"Not yet. We need a better grasp on this writing system before we begin anything else,\" I said, and then smiled when he mimed frustration. \"Patience, good sir. Patience is a virtue.\"\nYou'll be six when your father has a conference to attend in Hawaii, and we'll accompany him. You'll be so excited that you'll make preparations for weeks beforehand. You'll ask me about coconuts and volcanoes and surfing, and practice hula dancing in the mirror. You'll pack a suitcase with the clothes and toys you want to bring, and you'll drag it around the house to see how long you can carry it. You'll ask me if I can carry your Etch-a-Sketch in my bag, since there won't be any more room for it in yours and you simply can't leave without it.\n\"You won't need all of these,\" I'll say. \"There'll be so many fun things to do there, you won't have time to play with so many toys.\"\nYou'll consider that; dimples will appear above your eyebrows when you think hard. Eventually you'll agree to pack fewer toys, but your expectations will, if anything, increase.\n\"I wanna be in Hawaii now,\" you'll whine.\n\"Sometimes it's good to wait,\" I'll say. \"The anticipation makes it more fun when you get there.\"\nYou'll just pout.\nIn the next report I submitted, I suggested that the term \"logogram\" was a misnomer because it implied that each graph represented a spoken word, when in fact the graphs didn't correspond to our notion of spoken words at all. I didn't want to use the term \"ideogram\" either because of how it had been used in the past; I suggested the term \"semagram\" instead.\nIt appeared that a semagram corresponded roughly to a written word in human languages: it was meaningful on its own, and in combination with other semagrams could form endless statements. We couldn't define it precisely, but then no one had ever satisfactorily defined \"word\" for human languages either. When it came to sentences in Heptapod B, though, things became much more confusing. The language had no written punctuation: Its syntax was indicated in the way the semagrams were combined, and there was no need to indicate the cadence of speech. There was certainly no way to slice out subject-predicate pairings neatly to make sentences. A \"sentence\" seemed to be whatever number of semagrams a heptapod wanted to join together; the only difference between a sentence and a paragraph, or a page, was size.\nWhen a Heptapod B sentence grew fairly sizable, its visual impact was remarkable. If I wasn't trying to decipher it, the writing looked like fanciful praying mantids drawn in a cursive style, all clinging to each other to form an Escheresque lattice, each slightly different in its stance. And the biggest sentences had an effect similar to that of psychedelic posters: sometimes eye-watering, sometimes hypnotic.\nI remember a picture of you taken at your college graduation. In the photo you're striking a pose for the camera, mortarboard stylishly tilted on your head, one hand touching your sunglasses, the other hand on your hip, holding open your gown to reveal the tank top and shorts you're wearing underneath.\nI remember your graduation. There will be the distraction of having Nelson and your father and what's-her-name there all at the same time, but that will be minor. That entire weekend, while you're introducing me to your classmates and hugging everyone incessantly, I'll be all but mute with amazement. I can't believe that you, a grown woman taller than me and beautiful enough to make my heart ache, will be the same girl I used to lift off the ground so you could reach the drinking fountain, the same girl who used to trundle out of my bedroom draped in a dress and hat and four scarves from my closet.\nAnd after graduation, you'll be heading for a job as a financial analyst. I won't even understand what you do there, I won't even understand your fascination with money, the preeminence you gave to salary when negotiating job offers. I would prefer it if you'd pursue something without regard for its monetary rewards, but I'll have no complaints. My own mother could never understand why I couldn't just be a high school English teacher. You'll do what makes you happy, and that'll be all I ask for.\nAs time went on, the teams at each looking glass began working in earnest on learning heptapod terminology for elementary mathematics and physics. We worked together on presentations, with the linguists focusing on procedure and the physicists focusing on subject matter. The physicists showed us previously devised systems for communicating with aliens, based on mathematics, but those were intended for use over a radio telescope. We reworked them for face-to-face communication.\nOur teams were successful with basic arithmetic, but we hit a road block with geometry and algebra. We tried using a spherical coordinate system instead of a rectangular one, thinking it might be more natural to the heptapods given their anatomy, but that approach wasn't any more fruitful. The heptapods didn't seem to understand what we were getting at.\nLikewise, the physics discussions went poorly. Only with the most concrete terms, like the names of the elements, did we have any success; after several attempts at representing the periodic table, the heptapods got the idea. For anything remotely abstract, we might as well have been gibbering. We tried to demonstrate basic physical attributes like mass and acceleration so we could elicit their terms for them, but the heptapods simply responded with requests for clarification. To avoid perceptual problems that might be associated with any particular medium, we tried physical demonstrations as well as line drawings, photos, and animations; none were effective. Days with no progress became weeks, and the physicists were becoming disillusioned.\nBy contrast, the linguists were having much more success. We made steady progress decoding the grammar of the spoken language, Heptapod A. It didn't follow the pattern of human languages, as expected, but it was comprehensible so far: free word order, even to the extent that there was no preferred order for the clauses in a conditional statement, in defiance of a human language \"universal.\" It also appeared that the heptapods had no objection to many levels of center-embedding of clauses, something that quickly defeated humans. Peculiar, but not impenetrable.\nMuch more interesting were the newly discovered morphological and grammatical processes in Heptapod B that were uniquely two-dimensional. Depending on a semagram's declension, inflections could be indicated by varying a certain stroke's curvature, or its thickness, or its manner of undulation; or by varying the relative sizes of two radicals, or their relative distance to another radical, or their orientations; or various other means. These were non-segmental graphemes; they couldn't be isolated from the rest of a semagram. And despite how such traits behaved in human writing, these had nothing to do with calligraphic style; their meanings were defined according to a consistent and unambiguous grammar.\nWe regularly asked the heptapods why they had come. Each time, they answered\n\"to see,\" or \"to observe.\" Indeed, sometimes they preferred to watch us silently rather than answer our questions. Perhaps they were scientists, perhaps they were tourists. The State Department instructed us to reveal as little as possible about humanity, in case that information could be used as a bargaining chip in subsequent negotiations. We obliged, though it didn't require much effort: the heptapods never asked questions about anything. Whether scientists or tourists, they were an awfully incurious bunch.\nI remember once when we'll be driving to the mall to buy some new clothes for you. You'll be thirteen. One moment you'll be sprawled in your seat, completely unself-conscious, all child; the next, you'll toss your hair with a practiced casualness, like a fashion model in training.\nYou'll give me some instructions as I'm parking the car. \"Okay, Mom, give me one of the credit cards, and we can meet back at the entrance here in two hours.\"\nI'll laugh. \"Not a chance. All the credit cards stay with me.\"\n\"You're kidding.\" You'll become the embodiment of exasperation. We'll get out of the car and I will start walking to the mall entrance. After seeing that I won't budge on the matter, you'll quickly reformulate your plans.\n\"Okay Mom, okay. You can come with me, just walk a little ways behind me, so it doesn't look like we're together. If I see any friends of mine, I'm gonna stop and talk to them, but you just keep walking, okay? I'll come find you later.\"\nI'll stop in my tracks. \"Excuse me? I am not the hired help, nor am I some mutant relative for you to be ashamed of.\"\n\"But Mom, I can't let anyone see you with me.\"\n\"What are you talking about? I've already met your friends; they've been to the house.\"\n\"That was different,\" you'll say, incredulous that you have to explain it. \"This is shopping.\"\n\"Too bad.\"\nThen the explosion: \"You won't do the least thing to make me happy! You don't care about me at all!\"\nIt won't have been that long since you eǌoyed going shopping with me; it will forever astonish me how quickly you grow out of one phase and enter another. Living with you will be like aiming for a moving target; you'll always be further along than I expect.\nI looked at the sentence in Heptapod B that I had just written, using simple pen and paper. Like all the sentences I generated myself, this one looked misshapen, like a heptapod-written sentence that had been smashed with a hammer and then inexpertly taped back together. I had sheets of such inelegant semagrams covering my desk, fluttering occasionally when the oscillating fan swung past.\nIt was strange trying to learn a language that had no spoken form. Instead of practicing my pronunciation, I had taken to squeezing my eyes shut and trying to paint semagrams on the insides of my eyelids.\nThere was a knock at the door and before I could answer Gary came in looking jubilant. \"Illinois got a repetition in physics.\"\n\"Really? That's great; when did it happen?\"\n\"It happened a few hours ago; we just had the videoconference. Let me show you what it is.\" He started erasing my blackboard.\n\"Don't worry, I didn't need any of that.\"\n\"Good.\" He picked up a nub of chalk and drew a diagram: \"Okay, here's the path a ray of light takes when crossing from air to water. The light ray travels in a straight line until it hits the water; the water has a different index of refraction, so the light changes direction. You've heard of this before, right?\"\nI nodded. \"Sure.\"\n\"Now here's an interesting property about the path the light takes. The path is the fastest possible route between these two points.\"\n\"Come again?\"\n\"Imagine, just for grins, that the ray of light traveled along this path.\" He added a dotted line to his diagram: \"This hypothetical path is shorter than the path the light actually takes. But light travels more slowly in water than it does in air, and a greater percentage of this path is underwater. So it would take longer for light to travel along this path than it does along the real path.\"\n\"Okay, I get it.\"\n\"Now imagine if light were to travel along this other path.\" He drew a second dotted path: \"This path reduces the percentage that's underwater, but the total length is larger. It would also take longer for light to travel along this path than along the actual one.\"\nGary put down the chalk and gestured at the diagram on the chalkboard with white-tipped fingers. \"Any hypothetical path would require more time to traverse than the one actually taken. In other words, the route that the light ray takes is always the fastest possible one. That's Fermat's Principle of Least Time.\"\n\"Humm, interesting. And this is what the heptapods responded to?\"\n\"Exactly. Moorehead gave an animated presentation of Fermat's Principle at the Illinois looking glass, and the heptapods repeated it back. Now he's trying to get a symbolic description.\" He grinned. \"Now is that highly neat, or what?\"\n\"It's neat all right, but how come I haven't heard of Fermat's Principle before?\" I picked up a binder and waved it at him; it was a primer on the physics topics suggested for use in communication with the heptapods. \"This thing goes on forever about Planck masses and the spin-flip of atomic hydrogen, and not a word about the refraction of light.\"\n\"We guessed wrong about what'd be most useful for you to know,\" Gary said without embarrassment. \"In fact, it's curious that Fermat's Principle was the first breakthrough; even though it's easy to explain, you need calculus to describe it mathematically. And not ordinary calculus; you need the calculus of variations. We thought that some simple theorem of geometry or algebra would be the breakthrough.\"\n\"Curious indeed. You think the heptapods' idea of what's simple doesn't match ours?\"\n\"Exactly, which is why I'm dying to see what their mathematical description of Fermat's Principle looks like.\" He paced as he talked. \"If their version of the calculus of variations is simpler to them than their equivalent of algebra, that might explain why we've had so much trouble talking about physics; their entire system of mathematics may be topsyturvy compared to ours.\" He pointed to the physics primer. \"You can be sure that we're going to revise that.\"\n\"So can you build from Fermat's Principle to other areas of physics?\"\n\"Probably. There are lots of physical principles just like Fermat's.\"\n\"What, like Louise's principle of least closet space? When did physics become so minimalist?\"\n\"Well, the word 'least' is misleading. You see, Fermat's Principle of Least time is incomplete; in certain situations light follows a path that takes more time than any of the other possibilities. It's more accurate to say that light always follows an extreme path, either one that minimizes the time taken or one that maximizes it. A minimum and a maximum share certain mathematical properties, so both situations can be described with one equation. So to be precise, Fermat's Principle isn't a minimal principle; instead it's what's known as a 'variational' principle.\"\n\"And there are more of these variational principles?\"\nHe nodded. \"In all branches of physics. Almost every physical law can be restated as a variational principle. The only difference between these principles is in which attribute is minimized or maximized.\" He gestured as if the different branches of physics were arrayed before him on a table. \"In optics, where Fermat's Principle applies, time is the attribute that has to be an extreme. In mechanics, it's a different attribute. In electromagnetism, it's something else again. But all these principles are similar mathematically.\"\n\"So once you get their mathematical description of Fermat's Principle, you should be able to decode the other ones.\"\n\"God, I hope so. I think this is the wedge that we've been looking for, the one that cracks open their formulation of physics. This calls for a celebration.\" He stopped his pacing and turned to me. \"Hey Louise, want to go out for dinner? My treat.\"\nI was mildly surprised. \"Sure,\" I said.\nIt'll be when you first learn to walk that I get daily demonstrations of the asymmetry in our relationship. You'll be incessantly running off somewhere, and each time you walk into a doorframe or scrape your knee, the pain feels like it's my own. It'll be like growing an errant limb, an extension of myself whose sensory nerves report pain just fine, but whose motor nerves don't convey my commands at all. It's so unfair: I'm going to give birth to an animated voodoo doll of myself. I didn't see this in the contract when I signed up. Was this part of the deal?\nAnd then there will be the times when I see you laughing. Like the time you'll be playing with the neighbor's puppy, poking your hands through the chain-link fence separating our back yards, and you'll be laughing so hard you'll start hiccuping. The puppy will run inside the neighbor's house, and your laughter will gradually subside, letting you catch your breath. Then the puppy will come back to the fence to lick your fingers again, and you'll shriek and start laughing again. It will be the most wonderful sound I could ever imagine, a sound that makes me feel like a fountain, or a wellspring. Now if only I can remember that sound the next time your blithe disregard for self-preservation gives me a heart attack.\nAfter the breakthrough with Fermat's Principle, discussions of scientific concepts became more fruitful. It wasn't as if all of heptapod physics was suddenly rendered transparent, but progress was suddenly steady. According to Gary, the heptapods' formulation of physics was indeed topsy-turvy relative to ours. Physical attributes that humans defined using integral calculus were seen as fundamental by the heptapods. As an example, Gary described an attribute that, in physics jargon, bore the deceptively simple name \"action,\" which represented \"the difference between kinetic and potential energy, integrated over time,\" whatever that meant. Calculus for us; elementary to them.\nConversely, to define attributes that humans thought of as fundamental, like velocity, the heptapods employed mathematics that were, Gary assured me, \"highly weird.\"\nThe physicists were ultimately able to prove the equivalence of heptapod mathematics and human mathematics; even though their approaches were almost the reverse of one another, both were systems of describing the same physical universe.\nI tried following some of the equations that the physicists were coming up with, but it was no use. I couldn't really grasp the significance of physical attributes like \"action;\" I couldn't, with any confidence, ponder the significance of treating such an attribute as fundamental. Still, I tried to ponder questions formulated in terms more familiar to me: what kind of worldview did the heptapods have, that they would consider Fermat's Principle the simplest explanation of light refraction? What kind of perception made a minimum or maximum readily apparent to them?\nYour eyes will be blue like your dad's, not mud brown like mine. Boys will stare into those eyes the way I did, and do, into your dad's, surprised and enchanted, as I was and am, to find them in combination with black hair. You will have many suitors. I remember when you are fifteen, coming home after a weekend at your dad's, incredulous over the interrogation he'll have put you through regarding the boy you're currently dating. You'll sprawl on the sofa, recounting your dad's latest breach of common sense: \"You know what he said? He said, 'I know what teenage boys are like.'\" Roll of the eyes. \"Like I don't?\"\n\"Don't hold it against him,\" I'll say. \"He's a father; he can't help it.\" Having seen you interact with your friends, I won't worry much about a boy taking advantage of you; if anything, the opposite will be more likely. I'll worry about that.\n\"He wishes I were still a kid. He hasn't known how to act toward me since I grew breasts.\"\n\"Well, that development was a shock for him. Give him time to recover.\"\n\"It's been years, Mom. How long is it gonna take?\"\n\"I'll let you know when my father has come to terms with mine.\"\nDuring one of the videoconferences for the linguists, Cisneros from the Massachusetts looking glass had raised an interesting question: Was there a particular order in which semagrams were written in a Heptapod B sentence? It was clear that word order meant next to nothing when speaking in Heptapod A; when asked to repeat what it had just said, a heptapod would likely as not use a different word order unless we specifically asked them not to. Was word order similarly unimportant when writing in Heptapod B?\nPreviously, we had only focused our attention on how a sentence in Heptapod B looked once it was complete. As far as anyone could tell, there was no preferred order when reading the semagrams in a sentence; you could start almost anywhere in the nest, then follow the branching clauses until you'd read the whole thing. But that was reading; was the same true about writing?\nDuring my most recent session with Flapper and Raspberry I had asked them if, instead of displaying a semagram only after it was completed, they could show it to us while it was being written. They had agreed. I inserted the videotape of the session into the VCR, and on my computer I consulted the session transcript.\nI picked one of the longer utterances from the conversation. What Flapper had said was that the heptapods' planet had two moons, one significantly larger than the other; the three primary constituents of the planet's atmosphere were nitrogen, argon, and oxygen; and fifteen twenty-eighths of the planet's surface was covered by water. The first words of the spoken utterance translated literally as \"inequality-of-size rocky-orbiter rocky-orbiters related-as-primary- to-secondary.\"\nThen I rewound the videotape until the time signature matched the one in the transcription. I started playing the tape, and watched the web of semagrams being spun out of inky spider's silk. I rewound it and played it several times. Finally I froze the video right after the first stroke was completed and before the second one was begun; all that was visible onscreen was a single sinuous line.\nComparing that initial stroke with the completed sentence, I realized that the stroke participated in several different clauses of the message. It began in the semagram for 'oxygen,' as the determinant that distinguished it from certain other elements; then it slid down to become the morpheme of comparison in the description of the two moons' sizes; and lastly it flared out as the arched backbone of the semagram for 'ocean.' Yet this stroke was a single continuous line, and it was the first one that Flapper wrote. That meant the heptapod had to know how the entire sentence would be laid out before it could write the very first stroke.\nThe other strokes in the sentence also traversed several clauses, making them so interconnected that none could be removed without redesigning the entire sentence. The heptapods didn't write a sentence one semagram at a time; they built it out of strokes irrespective of individual semagrams. I had seen a similarly high degree of integration before in calligraphic designs, particularly those employing the Arabic alphabet. But those designs had required careful planning by expert calligraphers. No one could lay out such an intricate design at the speed needed for holding a conversation. At least, no human could.\nThere's a Joke that I once heard a comedienne tell. It goes like this: \"I'm not sure if I'm ready to have children. I asked a friend of mine who has children, 'Suppose I do have kids. What if when they grow up, they blame me for everything that's wrong with their lives?' She laughed and said, 'What do you mean, if?'\"\nThat's my favorite joke.\nGary and I were at a little Chinese restaurant, one of the local places we had taken to patronizing to get away from the encampment. We sat eating the appetizers: potstickers, redolent of pork and sesame oil. My favorite. I dipped one in soy sauce and vinegar. \"So how are you doing with your Heptapod B practice?\" I asked. Gary looked obliquely at the ceiling. I tried to meet his gaze, but he kept shifting it.\n\"You've given up, haven't you?\" I said. \"You're not even trying any more.\"\nHe did a wonderful hangdog expression. \"I'm just no good at languages,\" he confessed. \"I thought learning Heptapod B might be more like learning mathematics than trying to speak another language, but it's not. It's too foreign for me.\"\n\"It would help you discuss physics with them.\"\n\"Probably, but since we had our breakthrough, I can get by with just a few phrases.\"\nI sighed. \"I suppose that's fair; I have to admit, I've given up on trying to learn the mathematics.\"\n\"So we're even?\"\n\"We're even.\" I sipped my tea. \"Though I did want to ask you about Fermat's Principle. Something about it feels odd to me, but I can't put my finger on it. It just doesn't sound like a law of physics.\"\nA twinkle appeared in Gary's eyes. \"I'll bet I know what you're talking about.\" He snipped a potsticker in half with his chopsticks. \"You're used to thinking of refraction in terms of cause and effect: reaching the water's surface is the cause, and the change in direction is the effect. But Fermat's Principle sounds weird because it describes light's behavior in goal-oriented terms. It sounds like a commandment to a light beam: 'Thou shalt minimize or maximize the time taken to reach thy destination.'\"\nI considered it. \"Go on.\"\n\"It's an old question in the philosophy of physics. People have been talking about it since Fermat first formulated it in the 1600s; Planck wrote volumes about it. The thing is, while the common formulation of physical laws is causal, a variational principle like Fermat's is purposive, almost teleological.\"\n\"Hmm, that's an interesting way to put it. Let me think about that for a minute.\"\nI pulled out a felt-tip pen and, on my paper napkin, drew a copy of the diagram that Gary had drawn on my blackboard. \"Okay,\" I said, thinking aloud, \"So let's say the goal of a ray of light is to take the fastest path. How does the light go about doing that?\"\n\"Well, if I can speak anthropomorphic-projectionally, the light has to examine the possible paths and compute how long each one would take.\" He plucked the last potsticker from the serving dish.\n\"And to do that,\" I continued, \"the ray of light has to know just where its destination is. If the destination were somewhere else, the fastest path would be different.\"\nGary nodded again. \"That's right; the notion of a 'fastest path' is meaningless unless there's a destination specified. And computing how long a given path takes also requires information about what lies along that path, like where the water's surface is.\"\nI kept staring at the diagram on the napkin. \"And the light ray has to know all that ahead of time, before it starts moving, right?\"\n\"So to speak,\" said Gary. \"The light can't start traveling in any old direction and make course corrections later on, because the path resulting from such behavior wouldn't be the fastest possible one. The light has to do all its computations at the very beginning.\"\nI thought to myself, The ray of light has to know where it will ultimately end up before it can choose the direction to begin moving in. I knew what that reminded me of. I looked up at Gary. \"That's what was bugging me.\"\nI remember when you're fourteen. You'll come out of your bedroom, a graffiti-covered notebook computer in hand, working on a report for school.\n\"Mom, what do you call it when both sides can win?\"\nI'll look up from my computer and the paper I'll be writing. \"What, you mean a win-win situation?\"\n\"There's some technical name for it, some math word. Remember that time Dad was here, and he was talking about the stock market? He used it then.\"\n\"Hmm, that sounds familiar, but I can't remember what he called it.\"\n\"I need to know. I want to use that phrase in my social studies report. I can't even search for information on it unless I know what it's called.\"\n\"I'm sorry, I don't know it either. Why don't you call your dad?\"\nJudging from your expression, that will be more effort than you want to make. At this point, you and your father won't be getting along well. \"Can you call Dad and ask him? But don't tell him it's for me.\"\n\"I think you can call him yourself.\"\nYou'll fume, \"Jesus, Mom, I can never get help with my homework since you and Dad split up.\"\nIt's amazing the diverse situations in which you can bring up the divorce. \"I've helped you with your homework.\"\n\"Like a million years ago, Mom.\"\nI'll let that pass. \"I'd help you with this if I could, but I don't remember what it's called.\"\nYou'll head back to your bedroom in a huff.\nI practiced Heptapod B at every opportunity, both with the other linguists and by myself. The novelty of reading a semasiographic language made it compelling in a way that Heptapod A wasn't, and my improvement in writing it excited me. Over time, the sentences I wrote grew shapelier, more cohesive. I had reached the point where it worked better when I didn't think about it too much. Instead of carefully trying to design a sentence before writing, I could simply begin putting down strokes immediately; my initial strokes almost always turned out to be compatible with an elegant rendition of what I was trying to say. I was developing a faculty like that of the heptapods.\nMore interesting was the fact that Heptapod B was changing the way I thought. For me, thinking typically meant speaking in an internal voice' as we say in the trade, my thoughts were phonologically coded. My internal voice normally spoke in English, but that wasn't a requirement. The summer after my senior year in high school, I attended a total immersion program for learning Russian; by the end of the Summer, I was thinking and even dreaming in Russian. But it was always spoken Russian. Different language, same mode: a voice speaking silently aloud.\nThe idea of thinking in a linguistic yet non-phonological mode always intrigued me. I had a friend born of deaf parents; he grew up using American Sign Language, and he told me that he often thought in ASL instead of English. I used to wonder what it was like to have one's thoughts be manually coded, to reason using an inner pair of hands instead of an inner voice. With Heptapod B, I was experiencing something just as foreign: my thoughts were becoming graphically coded. There were trance-like moments during the day when my thoughts weren't expressed with my internal voice; instead, I saw semagrams with my mind's eye, sprouting like frost on a windowpane.\nAs I grew more fluent, semagraphic designs would appear fully-formed, articulating even complex ideas all at once. My thought processes weren't moving any faster as a result, though. Instead of racing forward, my mind hung balanced on the symmetry underlying the semagrams. The semagrams seemed to be something more than language; they were almost like mandalas. I found myself in a meditative state, contemplating the way in which premises and conclusions were interchangeable. There was no direction inherent in the way propositions were connected, no \"train of thought\" moving along a particular route; all the components in an act of reasoning were equally powerful, all having identical precedence.\nA representative from the State Department named Hossner had the job of briefing the U.S scientists on our agenda with the heptapods. We sat in the videoconference room, listening to him lecture. Our microphone was turned off, so Gary and I could exchange comments without interrupting Hossner. As we listened, I worried that Gary might harm his vision, rolling his eyes so often.\n\"They must have had some reason for coming all this way,\" said the diplomat, his voice tinny through the speakers. \"It does not look like their reason was conquest, thank God. But if that's not the reason, what is? Are they prospectors? Anthropologists? Missionaries? Whatever their motives, there must be something we can offer them. Maybe it's mineral rights to our solar system. May be it's information about ourselves. Maybe it's the right to deliver sermons to our populations. But we can be sure that there's something.\n\"My point is this: their motive might not be to trade, but that doesn't mean that we cannot conduct trade. We simply need to know why they're here, and what we have that they want. Once we have that information, we can begin trade negotiations.\n\"I should emphasize that our relationship with the heptapods need not be adversarial. This is not a situation where every gain on their part is a loss on ours, or vice versa. If we handle ourselves correctly, both we and the heptapods can come out winners.\"\n\"You mean it's a non-zero-sum game?\" Gary said in mock incredulity. \"Oh my gosh.\"\n\"A non-zero-sum game.\"\n\"What?\" You'll reverse course, heading back from your bedroom.\n\"When both sides can win: I just remembered, it's called a non-zero-sum game.\"\n\"That's it!\" you'll say, writing it down on your notebook. \"Thanks, Mom!\"\n\"I guess I knew it after all,\" I'll say. \"All those years with your father, some of it must have rubbed off.\"\n\"I knew you'd know it,\" you'll say. You'll give me a sudden, brief hug, and your hair will smell of apples. \"You're the best.\"\n\"Louise?\"\n\"Hmm? Sorry, I was distracted. What did you say?\"\n\"I said, what do you think about our Mr. Hossner here?\"\n\"I prefer not to.\"\n\"I've tried that myself: ignoring the government, seeing if it would go away. It hasn't.\"\nAs evidence of Gary's assertion, Hossner kept blathering: \"Your immediate tasks is to think back on what you've learned. Look for anything that might help us. Has there been any indication of what the heptapods want? Of what they value?\"\n\"Gee, it never occurred to us to look for things like that,\" I said. \"We'll get right on it, sir.\"\n\"The sad thing is, that's just what we'll have to do,\" said Gary.\n\"Are there any questions?\" asked Hossner.\nBurghart, the linguist at the Fort Worth looking glass, spoke up. \"We've been through this with the heptapods many times. They maintain that they're here to observe, and they maintain that information is not tradable.\"\n\"So they would have us believe,\" said Hossner. \"But consider: how could that be true? I know that the heptapods have occasionally stopped talking to us for brief periods. That may be a tactical maneuver on their part. If we were to stop talking to them tomorrow—\"\n\"Wake me up if he says something interesting,\" said Gary.\n\"I was just going to ask you to do the same for me.\"\nThat day when Gary first explained Fermat's Principle to me, he had mentioned that almost every physical law could be stated as a variational principle. Yet when humans thought about physical laws, they preferred to work with them in their causal formulation. I could understand that: the physical attributes that humans found intuitive, like kinetic energy or acceleration, were all properties of an object at a given moment in time. And these were conductive to a chronological, causal interpretation of events: one moment growing out of another, causes and effects created a chain reaction that grew from past to future.\nIn contrast, the physical attributes that the heptapods found intuitive, like \"action\" or those other things defined by integrals, were meaningful only over a period of time. And these were conductive to a teleological interpretation of events: by viewing events over a period of time, one recognized that there was a requirement that had to be satisfied, a goal of minimizing or maximizing. And one had to know the initial and final states to meet that goal; one needed knowledge of the effects before the causes could be initiated.\nI was growing to understand that, too.\n\"Why?\" you'll ask again. You'll be three.\n\"Because it's your bedtime,\" I'll say again. We'll have gotten as far as getting you bathed and into your jammies, but no further than that.\n\"But I'm not sleepy,\" you'll whine. You'll be standing at the bookshelf, pulling down a video to watch: your latest diversionary tactic to keep away from your bedroom.\n\"It doesn't matter: you still have to go to bed.\"\n\"But why?\"\n\"Because I'm the mom and I said so.\"\nI'm actually going to say that, aren't I? God, somebody please shoot me.\nI'll pick you up and carry you under my arm to your bed, you wailing piteously all the while, but my sole concern will be my own distress. All those vows made in childhood that I would give reasonable answers when I became a parent, that I would treat my own child as an intelligent, thinking individual, all for naught: I'm going to turn into my mother. I can fight it as much as I want, but there'll be no stopping my slide down that long, dreadful slope.\nWas it actually possible to know the future? Not simply to guess at it; was it possible to know what was going to happen, with absolute certainty and in specific detail? Gary once told me that the fundamental laws of physics were time-symmetric, that there was no physical difference between past and future. Given that, some might say, \"yes, theoretically.\" But speaking more concretely, most would answer \"no,\" because of free will.\nI liked to imagine the objection as a Borgesian fabulation: consider a person standing before the Book of Ages, the chronicle that records every event, past and future. Even though the text has been photoreduced from the full-sized edition, the volume is enormous. With magnifier in hand, she flips through the tissue-thin leaves until she locates the story of her life. She finds the passage that describes her flipping through the Book of Ages, and she skips to the next column, where it details what she'll be doing later in the day: acting on information she's read in the Book, she'll bet one hundred dollars on the racehorse Devil May Care and win twenty times that much. The thought of doing just that had crossed her mind, but being a contrary sort, she now resolves to refrain from betting on the ponies altogether.\nThere's the rub. The Book of Ages cannot be wrong; this scenario is based on the premise that a person is given knowledge of the actual future, not of some possible future. If this were Greek myth, circumstances would conspire to make her enact her fate despite her best efforts, but prophecies in myth are notoriously vague; the Book of Ages, is quite specific, and there's no way she can be forced to bet on a racehorse in the manner specified. The result is a contradiction: the Book of Ages must be right, by definition; yet no matter what the Book says she'll do, she can choose to do otherwise. How can these two facts be reconciled?\nThey can't be, was the common answer. A volume like the Book of Ages is a logical impossibility, for the precise reason that its existence would result in the above contradiction. Or, to be generous, some might say that the Book of Ages could exist, as long as it wasn't accessible to readers: that volume is housed in a special collection, and no one has viewing privileges.\nThe existence of free will meant that we couldn't know the future. And we knew free will existed because we had direct experience of it. Volition was an intrinsic part of consciousness.\nOr was it? What if the experience of knowing the future changed a person? What if it evoked a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation to act precisely as she knew she would?\nI stopped by Gary's office before leaving for the day. \"I'm calling it quits. Did you want to grab something to eat?\"\n\"Sure, just wait a second,\" he said. He shut down his computer and gathered some papers together. Then he looked up at me. \"Hey, want to come to my place for dinner tonight? I'll cook.\"\nI looked at him dubiously. \"You can cook?\"\n\"Just one dish,\" he admitted. \"But it's a good one.\"\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"I'm game.\"\n\"Great. We just need to go shopping for the ingredients.\"\n\"Don't go to any trouble—\"\n\"There's a market on the way to my house. It won't take a minute.\"\nWe took separate cars, me following him. I almost lost him when he abruptly turned in to a parking lot. It was a gourmet market, not large, but fancy; tall glass jars stuffed with imported foods sat next to specialty utensils on the store's stainless-steel shelves.\nI accompanied Gary as he collected fresh basil, tomatoes, garlic, linguini. \"There's a fish market next door; we can get fresh clams there,\" he said.\n\"Sounds good.\" We walked past the section of kitchen utensils. My gaze wandered over the shelves—peppermills, garlic presses, salad tongs—and stopped on a wooden salad bowl.\nWhen you are three, you'll pull a dishtowel off the kitchen counter and bring that salad bowl down on top of you. I'll make a grab for it, but I'll miss. The edge of the bowl will leave you with a cut, on the upper edge of your forehead, that will require a single stitch. Your father and I will hold you, sobbing and stained with Caesar Salad dressing, as we wait in the emergency room for hours.\nI reached out and took the bowl from the shelf. The motion didn't feel like something I was forced to do. Instead it seemed just as urgent as my rushing to catch the bowl when it falls on you: an instinct that I felt right in following.\n\"I could use a salad bowl like this.\"\nGary looked at the bowl and nodded approvingly. \"See, wasn't it a good thing that I had to stop at the market?\"\n\"Yes it was.\" We got in line to pay for our purchases.\nConsider the sentence \"The rabbit is ready to eat.\" Interpret \"rabbit\" to be the object of \"eat,\" and the sentence was an announcement that dinner would be served shortly. Interpret \"rabbit\" to be the subject of \"eat,\" and it was a hint, such as a young girl might give her mother so she'll open a bag of Purina Bunny Chow. Two very different utterances; in fact, they were probably mutually exclusive within a single household. Yet either was a valid interpretation; only context could determine what the sentence meant.\nConsider the phenomenon of light hitting water at one angle, and traveling through it at a different angle. Explain it by saying that a difference in the index of refraction caused the light to change direction, and one saw the world as humans saw it. Explain it by saying that light minimized the time needed to travel to its destination, and one saw the world as the heptapods saw it. Two very different interpretations.\nThe physical universe was a language with a perfectly ambiguous grammar. Every physical event was an utterance that could be parsed in two entirely different ways, one casual and the other teleological, both valid, neither one disqualifiable no matter how much context was available.\nWhen the ancestors of humans and heptapods first acquired the spark of consciousness, they both perceived the same physical world, but they parsed their perceptions differently; the world-views that ultimately across were the end result of that divergence. Humans had developed a sequential mode of awareness, while heptapods had developed a simultaneous mode of awareness. We experienced events in an order, and perceived their relationship as cause and effect. They experienced all events at once, and perceived a purpose underlying them all. A minimizing, maximizing purpose.\nI have a recurring dream about your death. In the dream, I'm the one who's rock climbing—me, can you imagine it?— and you're three years old, riding in some kind of backpack I'm wearing. We're just a few feet below a ledge where we can rest, and you won't wait until I've climbed up to it. You start pulling yourself out of the pack; I order you to stop, but of course you ignore me. I feel your weight alternating from one side of the pack to the other as you climb out; then I feel your left foot on my shoulder, and then your right. I'm screaming at you, but I can't get a hand free to grab you. I can see the wavy design on the soles of your sneakers as you climb, and then I see a flake of stone give way beneath one of them. You slide right past me, and I can't move a muscle. I look down and see you shrink into the distance below me.\nThen, all of a sudden, I'm at the morgue. An orderly lifts the sheet from your face, and I see that you're twenty-five.\n\"You okay?\"\nI was sitting upright in bed; I'd woken Gary with my movements. \"I'm fine. I was just startled; I didn't recognize where I was for a moment.\"\nSleepily, he said, \"We can stay at your place next time.\"\nI kissed him. \"Don't worry; your place is fine.\" We curled up, my back against his chest, and went back to sleep.\nWhen you're three and we're climbing a steep, spiral flight of stairs, I'll hold your hand extra tightly. You'll pull your hand away from me. \"I can do it by myself,\" you'll insist, and then move away from me to prove it, and I'll remember that dream. We'll repeat that scene countless times during your childhood. I can almost believe that, given your contrary nature, my attempts to protect you will be what create your love of climbing: first the jungle gym at the playground, then trees out in the green belt around our neighborhood, the rock walls at the climbing club, and ultimately cliff faces in national parks.\nI finished the last radical in the sentence, put down the chalk, and sat down in my desk chair. I leaned back and surveyed the giant Heptapod B sentence I'd written that covered the entire blackboard in my office. It included several complex clauses, and I had managed to integrate all of them rather nicely.\nLooking at a sentence like this one, I understood why the heptapods had evolved a semasiographic writing system like Heptapod B; it was better suited for a species with a simultaneous mode of consciousness. For them, speech was a bottleneck because it required that one word follow another sequentially. With writing, on the other hand, every mark on a page was visible simultaneously. Why constrain writing with a glottographic straitjacket, demanding that it be just as sequential as speech? It would never occur to them. Semasiographic writing naturally took advantage of the page's two-dimensionality; instead of doling out morphemes one at a time, it offered an entire page full of them all at once.\nAnd now that Heptapod B had introduced me to a simultaneous mode of consciousness, I understood the rationale behind Heptapod A's grammar: what my sequential mind had perceived as unnecessarily convoluted, I now recognized as an attempt to provide flexibility within the confines of sequential speech. I could use Heptapod A more easily as a result, though it was still a poor substitute for Heptapod B.\nThere was a knock at the door and then Gary poked his head in. \"Colonel Weber'll be here any minute.\"\nI grimaced. \"Right.\" Weber was coming to participate in a session with Flapper and Raspberry; I was to act as translator, a job I wasn't trained for and that I detested. Gary stepped inside and closed the door. He pulled me out of my chair and kissed me.\nI smiled. \"You trying to cheer me up before he gets here?\"\n\"No, I'm trying to cheer me up.\"\n\"You weren't interested in talking to the heptapods at all, were you? You worked on this project just to get me into bed.\"\n\"Ah, you see right through me.\"\nI looked into his eyes. \"You better believe it,\" I said.\nI remember when you'll be a month old, and I'll stumble out of bed to give you your 2:00 A.M. feeding. Your nursery will have that \"baby smell\" of diaper rash cream and talcum powder, with a faint ammoniac whiff coming from the diaper pail in the corner. I'll lean over your crib, lift your squalling form out, and sit in the rocking chair to nurse you.\nThe word \"infant\" is derived from the Latin word for \"unable to speak,\" but you'll be perfectly capable of saying one thing: \"I suffer,\" and you'll do it tirelessly and without hesitation. I have to admire your utter commitment to that statement; when you cry, you'll become outrage incarnate, every fiber of your body employed in expressing that emotion. It's funny: when you're tranquil, you will seem to radiate light, and if someone were to paint a portrait of you like that, I'd insist that they include the halo. But when you're unhappy, you will become a klaxon, built for radiating sound; a portrait of you then could simply be a fire alarm bell.\nAt that stage of your life, there'll be no past or future for you; until I give you my breast, you'll have no memory of contentment in the past nor expectation of relief in the future. Once you begin nursing, everything will reverse, and all will be right with the world. NOW is the only moment you'll perceive; you'll live in the present tense. In many ways, it's an enviable state.\nThe heptapods are neither free nor bound as we understand those concepts; they don't act according to their will, nor are they helpless automatons. What distinguishes the heptapods' mode of awareness is not just that their actions coincide with history's events; it is also that their motives coincide with history's purposes. They act to create the future, to enact chronology.\nFreedom isn't an illusion; it's perfectly real in the context of sequential consciousness. Within the context of simultaneous consciousness, freedom is not meaningful, but neither is coercion; it's simply a different context, no more or less valid than the other. It's like that famous optical illusion, the drawing of either an elegant young woman, face turned away from the viewer, or a wart-nosed crone, chin tucked down on her chest. There's no \"correct\" interpretation; both are equally valid. But you can't see both at the same time.\nSimilarly, knowledge of the future was incompatible with free will. What made it possible for me to exercise freedom of choice also made it impossible for me to know the future. Conversely, now that I know the future, I would never act contrary to that future, including telling others what I know: those who know the future don't talk about it. Those who've read the Book of Ages never admit to it.\nI turned on the VCR and slotted a cassette of a session from the Fort Worth looking glass. A diplomatic negotiator was having a discussion with the heptapods there, with Burghart acting as translator.\nThe negotiator was describing humans' moral beliefs, trying to lay some groundwork for the concept of altruism. I knew the heptapods were familiar with the conversation's eventual outcome, but they still participated enthusiastically. If I could have described this to someone who didn't already know, she might ask, if the heptapods already knew everything that they would ever say or hear, what was the point of their using language at all? A reasonable question. But language wasn't only for communication: it was also a form of action. According to speech act theory, statements like \"You're under arrest,\" \"I christen this vessel,\" or \"I promise\" were all performative: a speaker could perform the action only by uttering the words. For such acts, knowing what would be said didn't change anything. Everyone at a wedding anticipated the words \"I now pronounce you husband and wife,\" but until the minister actually said them, the ceremony didn't count. With performative language, saying equaled doing.\nFor the heptapods, all language was performative. Instead of using language to inform, they used language to actualize. Sure, heptapods already knew what would be said in any conversation; but in order for their knowledge to be true, the conversation would have to take place.\n\"First Goldilocks tried the papa bear's bowl of porridge, but it was full of brussels sprouts, which she hated.\"\nYou'll laugh. \"No, that's wrong!\" We'll be sitting side by side on the sofa, the skinny, overpriced hardcover spread open on our laps.\nI'll keep reading. \"Then Goldilocks tried the mama bear's bowl of porridge, but it was full of spinach, which she also hated.\"\nYou'll put your hand on the page of the book to stop me. \"You have to read it the right way!\"\n\"I'm reading just what it says here,\" I'll say, all innocence.\n\"No you're not. That's not how the story goes.\"\n\"Well if you already know how the story goes, why do you need me to read it to you?\"\n\"Cause I wanna hear it!\"\nThe air conditioning in Weber's office almost compensated for having to talk to the man.\n\"They're willing to engage in a type of exchange,\" I explained, \"but it's not trade. We simply give them something, and they give us something in return. Neither party tells the other what they're giving beforehand.\"\nColonel Weber's brow furrowed just slightly. \"You mean they're willing to exchange gifts?\"\nI knew what I had to say. \"We shouldn't think of it as 'gift-giving.' We don't know if this transaction has the same associations for the heptapods that gift-giving has for us.\"\n\"Can we—\" he searched for the right wording \"—drop hints about the kind of gift we want?\"\n\"They don't do that themselves for this type of transaction. I asked them if we could make a request, and they said we could, but it won't make them tell us what they're giving.\" I suddenly remembered that a morphological relative of \"performative\" was \"performance,\" which could describe the sensation of conversing when you knew what would be said: it was like performing in a play.\n\"But would it make them more likely to give us what we asked for?\" Colonel Weber asked. He was perfectly oblivious of the script, yet his responses matched his assigned lines exactly.\n\"No way of knowing,\" I said. \"I doubt it, given that it's not a custom they engage in.\"\n\"If we give our gift first, will the value of our gift influence the value of theirs?\"\nHe was improvising, while I had carefully rehearsed for this one and only show.\n\"No,\" I said. \"As far as we can tell, the value of the exchanged items is irrelevant.\"\n\"If only my relatives felt that way,\" murmured Gary wryly.\nI watched Colonel Weber turn to Gary. \"Have you discovered anything new in the physics discussions?\" he asked right on cue.\n\"If you mean, any information new to mankind, no,\" said Gary. \"The heptapods haven't varied from the routine. If we demonstrate something to them, they'll show us their formulation of it, but they won't volunteer anything and they won't answer our questions about what they know.\"\nAn utterance that was spontaneous and communicative in the context of human discourse became a ritual recitation when viewed by the light of Heptapod B.\nWeber scowled. \"All right then, we'll see how the State Department feels about this. Maybe we can arrange some kind of gift-giving ceremony.\"\nLike physical events, with their causal and teleological interpretations, every linguistic event had two possible interpretations: as a transmission of information and as the realization of a plan.\n\"I think that's a good idea, Colonel,\" I said.\nIt was an ambiguity invisible to most. A private joke; don't ask me to explain it.\nEven though I'm proficient with Heptapod B, I know I don't experience reality the way a heptapod does. My mind was cast in the mold of human, sequential languages, and no amount of immersion in an alien language can completely reshape it. My world-view is an amalgam of human and heptapod.\nBefore I learned how to think in Heptapod B, my memories grew like a column of cigarette ash, laid down by the infinitesimal sliver of combustion that was my consciousness, marking the sequential present. After I learned Heptapod B, new memories fell into place like gigantic blocks, each one measuring years in duration, and though they didn't arrive in order or land contiguously, they soon composed a period of five decades. It is the period during which I know Heptapod B well enough to think in it, starting during my interviews with Flapper and Raspberry and ending with my death.\nUsually, Heptapod B affects just my memory: my consciousness crawls along as it did before, a glowing sliver crawling forward in time, the difference being that the ash of memory lies ahead as well as behind: there is no real combustion. But occasionally I have glimpses when Heptapod B truly reigns, and I experience past and future all at once; my consciousness becomes a half century-long ember burning outside time. I perceive—during those glimpses—that entire epoch as a simultaneity. It's a period encompassing the rest of my life, and the entirety of yours.\nI wrote out the semagrams for \"process create-endpoint inclusive-we,\" meaning \"let's start.\" Raspberry replied in the affirmative, and the slide shows began. The second display screen that the heptapods had provided began presenting a series of images, composed of semagrams and equations, while one of our video screens did the same.\nThis was the second \"gift exchange\" I had been present for, the eighth one overall, and I knew it would be the last. The looking glass tent was crowded with people; Burghart from Fort Worth was here, as were Gary and a nuclear physicist, assorted biologists, anthropologists, military brass, and diplomats. Thankfully they had set up an air conditioner to cool the place off. We would review the tapes of the images later to figure out just what the heptapods' \"gift\" was. Our own \"gift\" was a presentation on the Lascaux cave paintings.\nWe all crowded around the heptapods' second screen, trying to glean some idea of the images' content as they went by. \"Preliminary assessments?\" asked Colonel Weber.\n\"It's not a return,\" said Burghart. In a previous exchange, the heptapods had given us informations about ourselves that we had previously told them. This had infuriated the State Department, but we had no reason to think of it as an insult: it probably indicated that trade value really didn't play a role in these exchanges. It didn't exclude the possibility that the heptapods might yet offer us a space drive, or cold fusion, or some other wish-fulfilling miracle.\n\"That looks like inorganic chemistry,\" said the nuclear physicist, pointing at an equation before the image was replaced.\nGary nodded. \"It could be materials technology,\" he said.\n\"Maybe we're finally getting somewhere,\" said Colonel Weber.\n\"I wanna see more animal pictures,\" I whispered, quietly so that only Gary could hear me, and pouted like a child. He smiled and poked me. Truthfully, I wished the heptapods had given another xenobiology lecture, as they had on two previous exchanges; judging from those, humans were more similar to the heptapods than any other species they'd ever encountered. Or another lecture on heptapod history; those had been filled with apparent non-sequiturs, but were interesting nonetheless. I didn't want the heptapods to give us new technology, because I didn't want to see what our governments might do with it.\nI watched Raspberry while the information was being exchanged, looking for any anomalous behavior. It stood barely moving as usual; I saw no indications of what would happen shortly.\nAfter a minute, the heptapod's screen went blank, and a minute after that, ours did too. Gary and most of the other scientists clustered around a tiny video screen that was replaying the heptapods' presentation. I could hear them talk about the need to call in a solid-state physicist.\nColonel Weber turned. \"You two,\" he said, pointing to me and then to Burghart, \"schedule the time and location for the next exchange.\" Then he followed the others to the playback screen.\n\"Coming right up,\" I said. To Burghart, I asked, \"Would you care to do the honors, or shall I?\"\nI knew Burghart had gained a proficiency in Heptapod B similar to mine. \"It's your looking glass,\" he said. \"You drive.\"\nI sat down again at the transmitting computer. \"Bet you never figured you'd wind up working as an Army translator back when you were a grad student.\"\n\"That's for goddamn sure,\" he said. \"Even now I can hardly believe it.\" Everything we said to each other felt like the carefully bland exchanges of spies who meet in public, but never break cover.\nI wrote out the semagrams for \"locus exchange-transaction converse inclusive-we\" with the projective aspect modulation.\nRaspberry wrote its reply. That was my cue to frown, and for Burghart to ask, \"What does it mean by that?\" His delivery was perfect.\nI wrote a request for clarification; Raspberry's reply was the same as before. Then I watched it glide out of the room.\nThe curtain was about to fall on this act of our performance. Colonel Weber stepped forward. \"What's going on? Where did it go?\"\n\"It said that the heptapods are leaving now,\" I said. \"Not just itself; all of them.\"\n\"Call it back here now. Ask it what it means.\"\n\"Um, I don't think Raspberry's wearing a pager,\" I said.\nThe image of the room in the looking glass disappeared so abruptly that it took a moment for my eyes to register what I was seeing instead: it was the other side of the looking-glass tent. The looking glass had become completely transparent. The conversation around the playback screen fell silent.\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" said Colonel Weber.\nGary walked up to the looking glass, and then around it to the other side. He touched the rear surface with one hand; I could see the pale ovals where his fingertips made contact with the looking glass. \"I think,\" he said, \"we just saw a demonstration of transmutation at a distance.\"\nI heard the sounds of heavy footfalls on dry grass. A soldier came in through the tent door, short of breath from sprinting, holding an oversize walkie-talkie. \"Colonel, message from—\"\nWeber grabbed the walkie-talkie from him.\nI remember what it'll be like watching you when you are a day old. Your father will have gone for a quick visit to the hospital cafeteria, and you'll be lying in your bassinet, and I'll be leaning over you.\nSo soon after the delivery, I will still be feeling like a wrung-out towel. You will seem incongruously tiny, given how enormous I felt during the pregnancy; I could swear there was room for someone much larger and more robust than you in there. Your hands and feet will be long and thin, not chubby yet. Your face will still be all red and pinched, puffy eyelids squeezed shut, the gnome-like phase that precedes the cherubic.\nI'll run a finger over your belly, marveling at the uncanny softness of your skin, wondering if silk would abrade your body like burlap. Then you'll writhe, twisting your body while poking out your legs one at a time, and I'll recognize the gesture as one I had felt you do inside me, many times. So that's what it looks like.\nI'll feel elated at this evidence of a unique mother-child bond, this certitude that you're the one I carried. Even if I had never laid eyes on you before, I'd be able to pick you out from a sea of babies: Not that one. No, not her either. Wait, that one over there.\nYes, that's her. She's mine.\nThat final \"gift exchange\" was the last we ever saw of the heptapods. All at once, all over the world, their looking glasses became transparent and their ships left orbit. Subsequent analysis of the looking glasses revealed them to be nothing more than sheets of fused silica, completely inert. The information from the final exchange session described a new class of superconducting materials, but it later proved to duplicate the results of research just completed in Japan: nothing that humans didn't already know.\nWe never did learn why the heptapods left, any more than we learned what brought them here, or why they acted the way they did. My own new awareness didn't provide that type of knowledge; the heptapods' behavior was presumably explicable from a sequential point of view, but we never found that explanation.\nI would have liked to experience more of the heptapods' world-view, to feel the way they feel. Then, perhaps I could immerse myself fully in the necessity of events, as they must, instead of merely wading in its surf for the rest of my life. But that will never come to pass. I will continue to practice the heptapod languages, as will the other linguists on the looking glass teams, but none of us will ever progress any further than we did when the heptapods were here.\nWorking with the heptapods changed my life. I met your father and learned Heptapod B, both of which make it possible for me to know you now, here on the patio in the moonlight. Eventually, many years from now, I'll be without your father, and without you. All I will have left from this moment is the heptapod language. So I pay close attention, and note every detail.\nFrom the beginning I knew my destination, and I chose my route accordingly. But am I working toward an extreme of joy, or of pain? Will I achieve a minimum, or a maximum?\nThese questions are in my mind when your father asks me, \"Do you want to make a baby?\" And I smile and answer, \"Yes,\" and I unwrap his arms from around me, and we hold hands as we walk inside to make love, to make you. From https://fyp.uoregon.edu/sites/default/files/chiang_story_of_your_life.pdf "},{"id":19,"href":"/site/library/clarke-superiority/","title":"Superiority","section":"Library","content":"IN MAKING THIS STATEMENT—which I do of my own free will—I wish first to make it perfectly clear that I am not in any way trying to gain sympathy, nor do I expect any mitigation of whatever sentence the Court may pronounce. I am writing this in an attempt to refute some of the lying reports broadcast over the prison radio and published in the papers I have been allowed to see. These have given an entirely false picture of the true cause of our defeat, and as the leader of my race's armed forces at the cessation of hostilities I feel it my duty to protest against such libels upon those who served under me.\nI also hope that this statement may explain the reasons for the application I have twice made to the Court, and will now induce it to grant a favor for which I can see no possible grounds of refusal.\nThe ultimate cause of our failure was a simple one: despite all statements to the contrary, it was not due to lack of bravery on the part of our men, or to any fault of the Fleet's. We were defeated by one thing only—by the inferior science of our enemies. I repeat—by the inferior science of our enemies.\nWhen the war opened we had no doubt of our ultimate victory. The combined fleets of our allies greatly exceeded in number and armament those which the enemy could muster against us, and in almost all branches of military science we were their superiors. We were sure that we could maintain this superiority. Our belief proved, alas, to be only too well founded.\nAt the opening of the war our main weapons were the long-range homing torpedo, dirigible ball-lightning and the various modifications of the Klydon beam. Every unit of the Fleet was equipped with these and though the enemy possessed similar weapons their installations were generally of lesser power. Moreover, we had behind us a far greater military Research Organization, and with this initial advantage we could not possibly lose.\nThe campaign proceeded according to plan until the Battle of the Five Suns. We won this, of course, but the opposition proved stronger than we had expected. It was realized that victory might be more difficult, and more delayed, than had first been imagined. A conference of supreme commanders was therefore called to discuss our future strategy.\nPresent for the first time at one of our war conferences was Professor-General Norden, the new Chief of the Research Staff, who had just been appointed to fill the gap left by the death of Malvar, our greatest scientist. Malvar's leadership had been responsible, more than any other single factor, for the efficiency and power of our weapons. His loss was a very serious blow, but no one doubted the brilliance of his successor—though many of us disputed the wisdom of appointing a theoretical scientist to fill a post of such vital importance. But we had been overruled.\nI can well remember the impression Norden made at that conference. The military advisers were worried, and as usual turned to the scientists for help. Would it be possible to improve our existing weapons, they asked, so that our present advantage could be increased still further?\nNorden's reply was quite unexpected. Malvar had often been asked such a question—and he had always done what we requested.\n“Frankly, gentlemen,” said Norden, “I doubt it. Our existing weapons have practically reached finality. I don't wish to criticize my predecessor, or the excellent work done by the Research Staff in the last few generations, but do you realize that there has been no basic change in armaments for over a century? It is, I am afraid, the result of a tradition that has become conservative. For too long, the Research Staff has devoted itself to perfecting old weapons instead of developing new ones. It is fortunate for us that our opponents have been no wiser: we cannot assume that this will always be so.”\nNorden's words left an uncomfortable impression, as he had no doubt intended. He quickly pressed home the attack.\n“What we want are new weapons—weapons totally different from any that have been employed before. Such weapons can be made: it will take time, of course, but since assuming charge I have replaced some of the older scientists with young men and have directed research into several unexplored fields which show great promise. I believe, in fact, that a revolution in warfare may soon be upon us.”\nWe were skeptical. There was a bombastic tone in Norden's voice that made us suspicious of his claims. We did not know, then, that he never promised anything that he had not already almost perfected in the laboratory. In the laboratory—that was the operative phrase.\nNorden proved his case less than a month later, when he demonstrated the Sphere of Annihilation, which produced complete disintegration of matter over a radius of several hundred meters. We were intoxicated by the power of the new weapon, and were quite prepared to overlook one fundamental defect—the fact that it was a sphere and hence destroyed its rather complicated generating equipment at the instant of formation. This meant, of course, that it could not be used on warships but only on guided missiles, and a great program was started to convert all homing torpedoes to carry the new weapon. For the time being all further offensives were suspended.\nWe realize now that this was our first mistake. I still think that it was a natural one, for it seemed to us then that all our existing weapons had become obsolete overnight, and we already regarded them as almost primitive survivals. What we did not appreciate was the magnitude of the task we were attempting, and the length of time it would take to get the revolutionary super-weapon into battle. Nothing like this had happened for a hundred years and we had no previous experience to guide us.\nThe conversion problem proved far more difficult than anticipated. A new class of torpedo had to be designed, as the standard model was too small. This meant in turn that only the larger ships could launch the weapon, but we were prepared to accept this penalty. After six months, the heavy units of the Fleet were being equipped with the Sphere. Training maneuvers and tests had shown that it was operating satisfactorily and we were ready to take it into action. Norden was already being hailed as the architect of victory, and had half promised even more spectacular weapons.\nThen two things happened. One of our battleships disappeared completely on a training flight, and an investigation showed that under certain conditions the ship's long-range radar could trigger the Sphere immediately after it had been launched. The modification needed to overcome this defect was trivial, but it caused a delay of another month and was the source of much bad feeling between the naval staff and the scientists. We were ready for action again—when Norden announced that the radius of effectiveness of the Sphere had now been increased by ten, thus multiplying by a thousand the chances of destroying an enemy ship.\nSo the modifications started all over again, but everyone agreed that the delay would be worth it. Meanwhile, however, the enemy had been emboldened by the absence of further attacks and had made an unexpected onslaught. Our ships were short of torpedoes, since none had been coming from the factories, and were forced to retire. So we lost the systems of Kyrane and Floranus, and the planetary fortress of Rhamsandron.\nIt was an annoying but not a serious blow, for the recaptured systems had been unfriendly, and difficult to administer. We had no doubt that we could restore the position in the near future, as soon as the new weapon became operational.\nThese hopes were only partially fulfilled. When we renewed our offensive, we had to do so with fewer of the Spheres of Annihilation than had been planned, and this was one reason for our limited success. The other reason was more serious.\nWhile we had been equipping as many of our ships as we could with the irresistible weapon, the enemy had been building feverishly. His ships were of the old pattern with the old weapons—but they now out-numbered ours. When we went into action, we found that the numbers ranged against us were often 100 percent greater than expected, causing target confusion among the automatic weapons and resulting in higher losses than anticipated. The enemy losses were higher still, for once a Sphere had reached its objective, destruction was certain, but the balance had not swung as far in our favor as we had hoped.\nMoreover, while the main fleets had been engaged, the enemy had launched a daring attack on the lightly held systems of Eriston, Duranus, Carmanidora and Pharanidon—recapturing them all. We were thus faced with a threat only fifty light-years from our home planets.\nThere was much recrimination at the next meeting of the supreme commanders. Most of the complaints were addressed to Norden-Grand Admiral Taxaris in particular maintaining that thanks to our admittedly irresistible weapon we were now considerably worse off than before. We should, he claimed, have continued to build conventional ships, thus preventing the loss of our numerical superiority.\nNorden was equally angry and called the naval staff ungrateful bunglers. But I could tell that he was worried—as indeed we all were—by the unexpected turn of events. He hinted that there might be a speedy way of remedying the situation.\nWe now know that Research had been working on the Battle Analyzer for many years, but at the time it came as a revelation to us and perhaps we were too easily swept off our feet. Norden's argument, also, was seductively convincing. What did it matter, he said, if the enemy had twice as many ships as we—if the efficiency of ours could be doubled or even trebled? For decades the limiting factor in warfare had been not mechanical but biological—it had become more and more difficult for any single mind, or group of minds, to cope with the rapidly changing complexities of battle in three-dimensional space. Norden's mathematicians had analyzed some of the classic engagements of the past, and had shown that even when we had been victorious we had often operated our units at much less than half of their theoretical efficiency.\nThe Battle Analyzer would change all this by replacing the operations staff with electronic calculators. The idea was not new, in theory, but until now it had been no more than a Utopian dream. Many of us found it difficult to believe that it was still anything but a dream: after we had run through several very complex dummy battles, however, we were convinced.\nIt was decided to install the Analyzer in four of our heaviest ships, so that each of the main fleets could be equipped with one. At this stage, the trouble began—though we did not know it until later.\nThe Analyzer contained just short of a million vacuum tubes and needed a team of five hundred technicians to maintain and operate it. It was quite impossible to accommodate the extra staff aboard a battleship, so each of the four units had to be accompanied by a converted liner to carry the technicians not on duty. Installation was also a very slow and tedious business, but by gigantic efforts it was completed in six months.\nThen, to our dismay, we were confronted by another crisis. Nearly five thousand highly skilled men had been selected to serve the Analyzers and had been given an intensive course at the Technical Training Schools. At the end of seven months, 10 percent of them had had nervous breakdowns and only 40 per cent had qualified.\nOnce again, everyone started to blame everyone else. Norden, of course, said that the Research Staff could not be held responsible, and so incurred the enmity of the Personnel and Training Commands. It was finally decided that the only thing to do was to use two instead of four Analyzers and to bring the others into action as soon as men could be trained. There was little time to lose, for the enemy was still on the offensive and his morale was rising.\nThe first Analyzer fleet was ordered to recapture the system of Eriston. On the way, by one of the hazards of war, the liner carrying the technicians was struck by a roving mine. A warship would have survived, but the liner with its irreplaceable cargo was totally destroyed. So the operation had to be abandoned.\nThe other expedition was, at first, more successful. There was no doubt at all that the Analyzer fulfilled its designers' claims, and the enemy was heavily defeated in the first engagements. He withdrew, leaving us in possession of Saphran, Leucon and Hexanerax. But his Intelligence Staff must have noted the change in our tactics and the inexplicable presence of a liner in the heart of our battlefleet. It must have noted, also, that our first fleet had been accompanied by a similar ship—and had withdrawn when it had been destroyed.\nIn the next engagement, the enemy used his superior numbers to launch an overwhelming attack on the Analyzer ship and its unarmed consort. The attack was made without regard to losses—both ships were, of course, very heavily protected—and it succeeded. The result was the virtual decapitation of the Fleet, since an effectual transfer to the old operational methods proved impossible. We disengaged under heavy fire, and so lost all our gains and also the systems of Lormyia, Ismarnus, Beronis, Alphanidon and Sideneus.\nAt this stage, Grand Admiral Taxaris expressed his disapproval of Norden by committing suicide, and I assumed supreme command.\nThe situation was now both serious and infuriating. With stubborn conservatism and complete lack of imagination, the enemy continued to advance with his old-fashioned and inefficient but now vastly more numerous ships. It was galling to realize that if we had only continued building, without seeking new weapons, we would have been in a far more advantageous position. There were many acrimonious conferences at which Norden defended the scientists while everyone else blamed them for all that had happened. The difficulty was that Norden had proved every one of his claims: he had a perfect excuse for all the disasters that had occurred. And we could not now turn back—the search for an irresistible weapon must go on. At first it had been a luxury that would shorten the war. Now it was a necessity if we were to end it victoriously.\nWe were on the defensive, and so was Norden. He was more than ever determined to reestablish his prestige and that of the Research Staff. But we had been twice disappointed, and would not make the same mistake again. No doubt Norden's twenty thousand scientists would produce many further weapons: we would remain unimpressed.\nWe were wrong. The final weapon was something so fantastic that even now it seems difficult to believe that it ever existed. Its innocent, noncommittal name—The Exponential Field—gave no hint of its real potentialities. Some of Norden's mathematicians had discovered it during a piece of entirely theoretical research into the properties of space, and to everyone's great surprise their results were found to be physically realizable.\nIt seems very difficult to explain the operation of the Field to the layman. According to the technical description, it “produces an exponential condition of space, so that a finite distance in normal, linear space may become infinite in pseudo-space.” Norden gave an analogy which some of us found useful. It was as if one took a flat disk of rubber—representing a region of normal space—and then pulled its center out to infinity. The circumference of the disk would be unaltered—but its “diameter” would be infinite. That was the sort of thing the generator of the Field did to the space around it.\nAs an example, suppose that a ship carrying the generator was surrounded by a ring of hostile machines. If it switched on the Field, each of the enemy ships would think that it—and the ships on the far side of the circle—had suddenly receded into nothingness. Yet the circumference of the circle would be the same as before: only the journey to the center would be of infinite duration, for as one proceeded, distances would appear to become greater and greater as the “scale” of space altered.\nIt was a nightmare condition, but a very useful one. Nothing could reach a ship carrying the Field: it might be englobed by an enemy fleet yet would be as inaccessible as if it were at the other side of the Universe. Against this, of course, it could not fight back without switching off the Field, but this still left it at a very great advantage, not only in defense but in offense. For a ship fitted with the Field could approach an enemy fleet undetected and suddenly appear in its midst.\nThis time there seemed to be no flaws in the new weapon. Needless to say, we looked for all the possible objections before we committed ourselves again. Fortunately the equipment was fairly simple and did not require a large operating staff. After much debate, we decided to rush it into production, for we realized that time was running short and the war was going against us. We had now lost about the whole of our initial gains and enemy forces had made several raids into our own solar system.\nWe managed to hold off the enemy while the Fleet was reequipped and the new battle techniques were worked out. To use the Field operationally it was necessary to locate an enemy formation, set a course that would intercept it, and then switch on the generator for the calculated period of time. On releasing the Field again—if the calculations had been accurate—one would be in the enemy's midst and could do great damage during the resulting confusion, retreating by the same route when necessary.\nThe first trial maneuvers proved satisfactory and the equipment seemed quite reliable. Numerous mock attacks were made and the crews became accustomed to the new technique. I was on one of the test flights and can vividly remember my impressions as the Field was switched on. The ships around us seemed to dwindle as if on the surface of an expanding bubble: in an instant they had vanished completely. So had the stars—but presently we could see that the Galaxy was still visible as a faint band of light around the ship. The virtual radius of our pseudo-space was not really infinite, but some hundred thousand light-years, and so the distance to the farthest stars of our system had not been greatly increased—though the nearest had of course totally disappeared. These training maneuvers, however, had to be canceled before they were completed, owing to a whole flock of minor technical troubles in various pieces of equipment, notably the communications circuits. These were annoying, but not important, though it was thought best to return to Base to clear them up.\nAt that moment the enemy made what was obviously intended to be a decisive attack against the fortress planet of Iton at the limits of our Solar System. The Fleet had to go into battle before repairs could be made.\nThe enemy must have believed that we had mastered the secret of invisibility—as in a sense we had. Our ships appeared suddenly out of no-where and inflicted tremendous damage—for a while. And then something quite baffling and inexplicable happened.\nI was in command of the flagship Hircania when the trouble started. We had been operating as independent units, each against assigned objectives. Our detectors observed an enemy formation at medium range and the navigating officers measured its distance with great accuracy. We set course and switched on the generator.\nThe Exponential Field was released at the moment when we should have been passing through the center of the enemy group. To our consternation, we emerged into normal space at a distance of many hundred miles—and when we found the enemy, he had already found us. We retreated, and tried again. This time we were so far away from the enemy that he located us first.\nObviously, something was seriously wrong. We broke communicator silence and tried to contact the other ships of the Fleet to see if they had experienced the same trouble. Once again we failed—and this time the failure was beyond all reason, for the communication equipment appeared to be working perfectly. We could only assume, fantastic though it seemed, that the rest of the Fleet had been destroyed.\nI do not wish to describe the scenes when the scattered units of the Fleet struggled back to Base. Our casualties had actually been negligible, but the ships were completely demoralized. Almost all had lost touch with one another and had found that their ranging equipment showed inexplicable errors. It was obvious that the Exponential Field was the cause of the troubles, despite the fact that they were only apparent when it was switched off.\nThe explanation came too late to do us any good, and Norden's final discomfiture was small consolation for the virtual loss of the war. As I have explained, the Field generators produced a radial distortion of space, distances appearing greater and greater as one approached the center of the artificial pseudo-space. When the Field was switched off, conditions returned to normal.\nBut not quite. It was never possible to restore the initial state exactly. Switching the Field on and off was equivalent to an elongation and contraction of the ship carrying the generator, but there was a hysteretic effect, as it were, and the initial condition was never quite reproducible, owing to all the thousands of electrical changes and movements of mass aboard the ship while the Field was on. These asymmetries and distortions were cumulative, and though they seldom amounted to more than a fraction of one per cent, that was quite enough. It meant that the precision ranging equipment and the tuned circuits in the communication apparatus were thrown completely out of adjustment. Any single ship could never detect the change—only when it compared its equipment with that of another vessel, or tried to communicate with it, could it tell what had happened.\nIt is impossible to describe the resultant chaos. Not a single component of one ship could be expected with certainty to work aboard another. The very nuts and bolts were no longer interchangeable, and the supply position became quite impossible. Given time, we might even have overcome these difficulties, but the enemy ships were already attacking in thousands with weapons which now seemed centuries behind those that we had invented. Our magnificent Fleet, crippled by our own science, fought on as best it could until it was overwhelmed and forced to surrender. The ships fitted with the Field were still invulnerable, but as fighting units they were almost helpless. Every time they switched on their generators to escape from enemy attack, the permanent distortion of their equipment increased. In a month, it was all over.\nTHIS IS THE true story of our defeat, which I give without prejudice to my defense before this Court. I make it, as I have said, to counteract the libels that have been circulating against the men who fought under me, and to show where the true blame for our misfortunes lay.\nFinally, my request, which as the Court will now realize I make in no frivolous manner and which I hope will therefore be granted.\nThe Court will be aware that the conditions under which we are housed and the constant surveillance to which we are subjected night and day are somewhat distressing. Yet I am not complaining of this: nor do I complain of the fact that shortage of accommodation has made it necessary to house us in pairs.\nBut I cannot be held responsible for my future actions if I am compelled any longer to share my cell with Professor Norden, late Chief of the Research Staff of my armed forces.\nFrom https://archive.org/details/Fantasy_Science_Fiction_v002n04_1951-08_AK "},{"id":20,"href":"/site/docs/solar-system/0-planetary-science/terraforming/","title":"Terraforming Planets","section":"Planetary Science","content":"https://www.universetoday.com/121140/could-we-terraform-the-moon/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/128711/how-do-we-terraform-ceres/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/139725/uh-oh-mars-doesnt-have-enough-carbon-dioxide-to-be-terraformed/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/139481/could-cyanobacteria-help-to-terraform-mars/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/134230/future-space-colonization-terraforming-space-habitats/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/128531/terraform-mercury/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/128532/terraform-saturns-moons/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/128530/how-do-we-terraform-jupiters-moons/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/113346/how-do-we-terraform-mars/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/113412/how-do-we-terraform-venus/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/127311/guide-to-terraforming/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/91920/should-we-terraform-mars/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/15795/podcast-humans-to-mars-part-3-terraforming-mars/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/9730/zubrin-on-terraforming-mars/\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/9383/terraforming-mars-one-piece-at-a-time/\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/site/library/guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction/","title":"The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction","section":"Library","content":"In the temperate and tropical regions where it appears that hominids evolved into human beings, the principal food of the species was vegetable. Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food. The mammoth hunters spectacularly occupy the cave wall and the mind, but what we actually did to stay alive and fat was gather seeds, roots, sprouts, shoots, leaves, nuts, berries, fruits, and grains, adding bugs and mollusks and netting or snaring birds, fish, rats, rabbits, and other tuskless small fry to up the protein. And we didn't even work hard at it— much less hard than peasants slaving in somebody else's field after agriculture was invented, much less hard than paid workers since civilization was invented. The average prehistoric person could make a nice living in about a fifteen-hour work week. Fifteen hours a week for subsistence leaves a lot of time for other things. So much time that maybe the restless ones who didn't have a baby around to enliven their life, or skill in making or cooking or singing, or very interesting thoughts to think, decided to slope off and hunt mammoths. The skillful hunters then would come staggering back with a load of meat, a lot of ivory, and a story. It wasn't the meat that made the difference. It was the story. It is hard to tell a really gripping tale of how I wrested a wild-oat seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats.... No, it does not compare, it cannot compete with how I thrust my spear deep into the titanic hairy flank while Oob, impaled on one huge sweeping tusk, writhed screaming, and blood spouted everywhere in crimson torrents, and Boob was crushed to jelly when the mammoth fell on him as I shot my unerring arrow straight through eye to brain. That story not only has Action, it has a Hero. Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch and their kids and the skills of the makers and the thoughts of the thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all been pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn't their story. It's his. When she was planning the book that ended up as Three Guineas, Virginia Woolf wrote a heading in her notebook, \"Glossary\"; she had thought of reinventing English according to a new plan, in order to tell a different story. One of the entries in this glossary is heroism, defined as \"botulism.\" And hero, in Woolf's dictionary, is \"bottle.\" The hero as bottle, a stringent reevaluation. I now propose the bottle as hero. Not just the bottle of gin or wine, but bottle in its older sense of container in general, a thing that holds something else. If you haven't got something to put it in, food will escape you—even something as uncombative and unresourceful as an oat. You put as many as you can into your stomach while they are handy, that being the primary container; but what about tomorrow morning when you wake up and it's cold and raining and wouldn't it be good to have just a few handfuls of oats to chew on and give little Oom to make her shut up, but how do you get more than one stomachful and one handful home? So you get up and go to the damned soggy oat patch in the rain, and wouldn't it be a good thing if you had something to put Baby Oo Oo in so that you could pick the oats with both hands? A leaf a gourd a shell a net a bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. A recipient. The first cultural device was probably a recipient .... Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier. So says Elizabeth Fisher in Women's Creation (McGraw-Hill, 1975). But no, this cannot be. Where is that wonderful, big, long, hard thing, a bone, I believe, that the Ape Man first bashed somebody within the movie and then, grunting with ecstasy at having achieved the first proper murder, flung up into the sky, and whirling there it became a space ship thrusting its way into the cosmos to fertilize it and produce at the end of the movie a lovely fetus, a boy of course, drifting around the Milky Way without (oddly enough) any womb, any matrix at all? I don't know. I don't even care. I'm not telling that story. We've heard it, we've all heard all about all the sticks spears and swords, the things to bash and poke and hit with, the long, hard things, but we have not heard about the thing to put things in, the container for the thing contained. That is a new story. That is news. And yet old. Before—once you think about it, surely long before—the weapon, a late, luxurious, superfluous tool; long before the useful knife and ax; right along with the indispensable whacker, grinder, and digger—for what's the use of digging up a lot of potatoes if you have nothing to lug ones you can't eat home in—with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home. It makes sense to me. I am an adherent of what Fisher calls the Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution. This theory not only explains large areas of theoretical obscurity and avoids large areas of theoretical nonsense (inhabited largely by tigers, foxes, other highly territorial mammals); it also grounds me, personally, in human culture in a way I never felt grounded before. So long as culture was explained as originating from and elaborating upon the use of long, hard objects for sticking, bashing, and killing, I never thought that I had, or wanted, any particular share in it. (\"What Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman's lack of loyalty to civilization,\" Lillian Smith observed.) The society, the civilization they were talking about, these theoreticians, was evidently theirs; they owned it, they liked it; they were human, fully human, bashing, sticking, thrusting, killing. Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that's what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all. That's right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero. Go on, say I, wandering off towards the wild oats, with Oo Oo in the sling and little Oom carrying the basket. You just go on telling how the mammoth fell on Boob and how Cain fell on Abel and how the bomb fell on Nagasaki and how the burning jelly fell on the villagers and how the missiles will fall on the Evil Empire, and all the other steps in the Ascent of Man. If it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because it's useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for people, and then later on you take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and then next day you probably do much the same again—if to do that is human, if that's what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time. Not, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don't, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It's just one of those damned things you have to do in order to be able to go on gathering wild oats and telling stories. It is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my humanity from me, the story the mammoth hunters told about bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful, poisonous story of Botulism. The killer story. It sometimes seems that that story is approaching its end. Lest there be no more telling of stories at all, some of us out here in the wild oats, amid the alien corn, think we'd better start telling another one, which maybe people can go on with when the old one's finished. Maybe. The trouble is, we've all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story. It's unfamiliar, it doesn't come easily, thoughtlessly to the lips as the killer story does; but still, \"untold\" was an exaggeration. People have been telling the life story for ages, in all sorts of words and ways. Myths of creation and transformation, trickster stories, folktales, jokes, novels... The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story. Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it. So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting here and going straight there and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn't any good if he isn't in it. I differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us. One relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of conflict, but the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd. (I have read a how-to-write manual that said, \"A story should be seen as a battle,\" and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict, competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle, may be seen as necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process. Finally, it's clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. You put him in a bag and he looks like a rabbit, like a potato. That is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them. So, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this great heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on another world, and a mouse's skull; full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and delusions; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and people who don't understand. I said it was hard to make a gripping tale of how we wrested the wild oats from their husks, I didn't say it was impossible. Who ever said writing a novel was easy? If science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic. \"Technology,\" or \"modern science\" (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the \"hard\" sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now). If, however, one avoids the linear, progressive, Time's- (killing)-arrow mode of the Techno-Heroic, and redefines technology and science as primarily cultural carrier bag rather than weapon of domination, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a realistic one. It is a strange realism, but it is a strange reality. Science fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what people actually do and feel, how people relate to everything else in this vast sack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be and tomb of things that were, this unending story. In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool's joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn't over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.\nFrom https://theanarchistlibrary.org/mirror/u/uk/ursula-k-le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf "},{"id":22,"href":"/site/library/vinge-the-coming-technological-singularity/","title":"The Coming Technological Singularity","section":"Library","content":" The Coming Technological Singularity:\nHow to Survive in the Post-Human Era\nVernor Vinge\nDepartment of Mathematical Sciences\nSan Diego State University\n(c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge\n(Verbatim copying/translation and distribution of this entire article is permitted in any medium, provided this notice is preserved.)\nThis article was for the VISION-21 Symposium sponsored by NASA Lewis Research Center and the Ohio Aerospace Institute, March 30-31, 1993. It is also retrievable from the NASA technical reports server as part of NASA CP-10129. A slightly changed version appeared in the Winter 1993 issue of Whole Earth Review.\nAbstract # Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended.\nIs such progress avoidable? If not to be avoided, can events be guided so that we may survive? These questions are investigated. Some possible answers (and some further dangers) are presented.\nWhat is The Singularity? # The acceleration of technological progress has been the central feature of this century. I argue in this paper that we are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth. The precise cause of this change is the imminent creation by technology of entities with greater than human intelligence. There are several means by which science may achieve this breakthrough (and this is another reason for having confidence that the event will occur):\nThe development of computers that are \u0026ldquo;awake\u0026rdquo; and superhumanly intelligent. (To date, most controversy in the area of AI relates to whether we can create human equivalence in a machine. But if the answer is \u0026ldquo;yes, we can\u0026rdquo;, then there is little doubt that beings more intelligent can be constructed shortly thereafter. Large computer networks (and their associated users) may \u0026ldquo;wake up\u0026rdquo; as a superhumanly intelligent entity. Computer/human interfaces may become so intimate that users may reasonably be considered superhumanly intelligent. Biological science may find ways to improve upon the natural human intellect. The first three possibilities depend in large part on improvements in computer hardware. Progress in computer hardware has followed an amazingly steady curve in the last few decades [16]. Based largely on this trend, I believe that the creation of greater than human intelligence will occur during the next thirty years. (Charles Platt [19] has pointed out the AI enthusiasts have been making claims like this for the last thirty years. Just so I\u0026rsquo;m not guilty of a relative-time ambiguity, let me more specific: I\u0026rsquo;ll be surprised if this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030.)\nWhat are the consequences of this event? When greater-than-human intelligence drives progress, that progress will be much more rapid. In fact, there seems no reason why progress itself would not involve the creation of still more intelligent entities — on a still-shorter time scale. The best analogy that I see is with the evolutionary past: Animals can adapt to problems and make inventions, but often no faster than natural selection can do its work — the world acts as its own simulator in the case of natural selection. We humans have the ability to internalize the world and conduct \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; in our heads; we can solve many problems thousands of times faster than natural selection. Now, by creating the means to execute those simulations at much higher speeds, we are entering a regime as radically different from our human past as we humans are from the lower animals.\nFrom the human point of view this change will be a throwing away of all the previous rules, perhaps in the blink of an eye, an exponential runaway beyond any hope of control. Developments that before were thought might only happen in \u0026ldquo;a million years\u0026rdquo; (if ever) will likely happen in the next century. (In [4], Greg Bear paints a picture of the major changes happening in a matter of hours.)\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to call this event a singularity (\u0026ldquo;the Singularity\u0026rdquo; for the purposes of this paper). It is a point where our models must be discarded and a new reality rules. As we move closer and closer to this point, it will loom vaster and vaster over human affairs till the notion becomes a commonplace. Yet when it finally happens it may still be a great surprise and a greater unknown. In the 1950s there were very few who saw it: Stan Ulam [27] paraphrased John von Neumann as saying:\nOne conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.\nVon Neumann even uses the term singularity, though it appears he is still thinking of normal progress, not the creation of superhuman intellect. (For me, the superhumanity is the essence of the Singularity. Without that we would get a glut of technical riches, never properly absorbed (see [24]).)\nIn the 1960s there was recognition of some of the implications of superhuman intelligence. I. J. Good wrote [10]:\nLet an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an \u0026ldquo;intelligence explosion,\u0026rdquo; and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control\u0026hellip;.It is more probable than not that, within the twentieth century, an ultraintelligent machine will be built and that it will be the last invention that man need make.\nGood has captured the essence of the runaway, but does not pursue its most disturbing consequences. Any intelligent machine of the sort he describes would not be humankind\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;tool\u0026rdquo; — any more than humans are the tools of rabbits or robins or chimpanzees.\nThrough the \u0026rsquo;60s and \u0026rsquo;70s and \u0026rsquo;80s, recognition of the cataclysm spread [28] [1] [30] [4]. Perhaps it was the science-fiction writers who felt the first concrete impact. After all, the \u0026ldquo;hard\u0026rdquo; science-fiction writers are the ones who try to write specific stories about all that technology may do for us. More and more, these writers felt an opaque wall across the future. Once, they could put such fantasies millions of years in the future [23]. Now they saw that their most diligent extrapolations resulted in the unknowable \u0026hellip; soon. Once, galactic empires might have seemed a Post-Human domain. Now, sadly, even interplanetary ones are.\nWhat about the \u0026rsquo;90s and the \u0026rsquo;00s and the \u0026rsquo;10s, as we slide toward the edge? How will the approach of the Singularity spread across the human world view? For a while yet, the general critics of machine sapience will have good press. After all, till we have hardware as powerful as a human brain it is probably foolish to think we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to create human equivalent (or greater) intelligence. (There is the far-fetched possibility that we could make a human equivalent out of less powerful hardware, if were willing to give up speed, if we were willing to settle for an artificial being who was literally slow [29]. But it\u0026rsquo;s much more likely that devising the software will be a tricky process, involving lots of false starts and experimentation. If so, then the arrival of self-aware machines will not happen till after the development of hardware that is substantially more powerful than humans\u0026rsquo; natural equipment.)\nBut as time passes, we should see more symptoms. The dilemma felt by science fiction writers will be perceived in other creative endeavors. (I have heard thoughtful comic book writers worry about how to have spectacular effects when everything visible can be produced by the technically commonplace.) We will see automation replacing higher and higher level jobs. We have tools right now (symbolic math programs, cad/cam) that release us from most low-level drudgery. Or put another way: The work that is truly productive is the domain of a steadily smaller and more elite fraction of humanity. In the coming of the Singularity, we are seeing the predictions of true technological unemployment finally come true.\nAnother symptom of progress toward the Singularity: ideas themselves should spread ever faster, and even the most radical will quickly become commonplace. When I began writing, it seemed very easy to come up with ideas that took decades to percolate into the cultural consciousness; now the lead time seems more like eighteen months. (Of course, this could just be me losing my imagination as I get old, but I see the effect in others too.) Like the shock in a compressible flow, the Singularity moves closer as we accelerate through the critical speed.\nAnd what of the arrival of the Singularity itself? What can be said of its actual appearance? Since it involves an intellectual runaway, it will probably occur faster than any technical revolution seen so far. The precipitating event will likely be unexpected — perhaps even to the researchers involved. (\u0026ldquo;But all our previous models were catatonic! We were just tweaking some parameters\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo;) If networking is widespread enough (into ubiquitous embedded systems), it may seem as if our artifacts as a whole had suddenly wakened.\nAnd what happens a month or two (or a day or two) after that? I have only analogies to point to: The rise of humankind. We will be in the Post-Human era. And for all my rampant technological optimism, sometimes I think I\u0026rsquo;d be more comfortable if I were regarding these transcendental events from one thousand years remove \u0026hellip; instead of twenty. ## Can the Singularity be Avoided?\nWell, maybe it won\u0026rsquo;t happen at all: Sometimes I try to imagine the symptoms that we should expect to see if the Singularity is not to develop. There are the widely respected arguments of Penrose [18] and Searle [21] against the practicality of machine sapience. In August of 1992, Thinking Machines Corporation held a workshop to investigate the question \u0026ldquo;How We Will Build a Machine that Thinks\u0026rdquo; [Thearling]. As you might guess from the workshop\u0026rsquo;s title, the participants were not especially supportive of the arguments against machine intelligence. In fact, there was general agreement that minds can exist on nonbiological substrates and that algorithms are of central importance to the existence of minds. However, there was much debate about the raw hardware power that is present in organic brains. A minority felt that the largest 1992 computers were within three orders of magnitude of the power of the human brain. The majority of the participants agreed with Moravec\u0026rsquo;s estimate [16] that we are ten to forty years away from hardware parity. And yet there was another minority who pointed to [6] [20], and conjectured that the computational competence of single neurons may be far higher than generally believed. If so, our present computer hardware might be as much as ten orders of magnitude short of the equipment we carry around in our heads. If this is true (or for that matter, if the Penrose or Searle critique is valid), we might never see a Singularity. Instead, in the early \u0026rsquo;00s we would find our hardware performance curves begin to level off — this caused by our inability to automate the complexity of the design work necessary to support the hardware trend curves. We\u0026rsquo;d end up with some very powerful hardware, but without the ability to push it further. Commercial digital signal processing might be awesome, giving an analog appearance even to digital operations, but nothing would ever \u0026ldquo;wake up\u0026rdquo; and there would never be the intellectual runaway which is the essence of the Singularity. It would likely be seen as a golden age \u0026hellip; and it would also be an end of progress. This is very like the future predicted by Gunther Stent. In fact, on page 137 of [24], Stent explicitly cites the development of transhuman intelligence as a sufficient condition to break his projections.\nBut if the technological Singularity can happen, it will. Even if all the governments of the world were to understand the \u0026ldquo;threat\u0026rdquo; and be in deadly fear of it, progress toward the goal would continue. In fiction, there have been stories of laws passed forbidding the construction of \u0026ldquo;a machine in the form of the mind of man\u0026rdquo; [12]. In fact, the competitive advantage — economic, military, even artistic — of every advance in automation is so compelling that passing laws, or having customs, that forbid such things merely assures that someone else will get them first.\nEric Drexler [7] has provided spectacular insight about how far technical improvement may go. He agrees that superhuman intelligences will be available in the near future — and that such entities pose a threat to the human status quo. But Drexler argues that we can embed such transhuman devices in rules or physical confinement such that their results can be examined and used safely. This is I. J. Good\u0026rsquo;s ultraintelligent machine, with a dose of caution. I argue that confinement is intrinsically impractical. For the case of physical confinement: Imagine yourself confined to your house with only limited data access to the outside, to your masters. If those masters thought at a rate — say — one million times slower than you, there is little doubt that over a period of years (your time) you could come up with \u0026ldquo;helpful advice\u0026rdquo; that would incidentally set you free. (I call this \u0026ldquo;fast thinking\u0026rdquo; form of superintelligence \u0026ldquo;weak superhumanity\u0026rdquo;. Such a \u0026ldquo;weakly superhuman\u0026rdquo; entity would probably burn out in a few weeks of outside time. \u0026ldquo;Strong superhumanity\u0026rdquo; would be more than cranking up the clock speed on a human-equivalent mind. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to say precisely what \u0026ldquo;strong superhumanity\u0026rdquo; would be like, but the difference appears to be profound. Imagine running a dog mind at very high speed. Would a thousand years of doggy living add up to any human insight? (Now if the dog mind were cleverly rewired and then run at high speed, we might see something different\u0026hellip;.) Most speculations about superintelligence seem to be based on the weakly superhuman model. I believe that our best guesses about the post-Singularity world can be obtained by thinking on the nature of strong superhumanity. I will return to this point later in the paper.)\nThe other approach to Drexlerian confinement is to build rules into the mind of the created superhuman entity (Asimov\u0026rsquo;s Laws). I think that performance rules strict enough to be safe would also produce a device whose ability was clearly inferior to the unfettered versions (and so human competition would favor the development of the those more dangerous models). Still, the Asimov dream is a wonderful one: Imagine a willing slave, who has 1000 times your capabilities in every way. Imagine a creature who could satisfy your every safe wish (whatever that means) and still have 99.9% of its time free for other activities. There would be a new universe we never really understood, but filled with benevolent gods (though one of my wishes might be to become one of them).\nIf the Singularity can not be prevented or confined, just how bad could the Post-Human era be? Well \u0026hellip; pretty bad. The physical extinction of the human race is one possibility. (Or as Eric Drexler put it of nanotechnology: Given all that such technology can do, perhaps governments would simply decide that they no longer need citizens!). Yet physical extinction may not be the scariest possibility. Again, analogies: Think of the different ways we relate to animals. Some of the crude physical abuses are implausible, yet\u0026hellip;. In a Post-Human world there would still be plenty of niches where human equivalent automation would be desirable: embedded systems in autonomous devices, self-aware daemons in the lower functioning of larger sentients. (A strongly superhuman intelligence would likely be a Society of Mind [15] with some very competent components.) Some of these human equivalents might be used for nothing more than digital signal processing. They would be more like whales than humans. Others might be very human-like, yet with a one-sidedness, a dedication that would put them in a mental hospital in our era. Though none of these creatures might be flesh-and-blood humans, they might be the closest things in the new enviroment to what we call human now. (I. J. Good had something to say about this, though at this late date the advice may be moot: Good [11] proposed a \u0026ldquo;Meta-Golden Rule\u0026rdquo;, which might be paraphrased as \u0026ldquo;Treat your inferiors as you would be treated by your superiors.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s a wonderful, paradoxical idea (and most of my friends don\u0026rsquo;t believe it) since the game-theoretic payoff is so hard to articulate. Yet if we were able to follow it, in some sense that might say something about the plausibility of such kindness in this universe.)\nI have argued above that we cannot prevent the Singularity, that its coming is an inevitable consequence of the humans\u0026rsquo; natural competitiveness and the possibilities inherent in technology. And yet \u0026hellip; we are the initiators. Even the largest avalanche is triggered by small things. We have the freedom to establish initial conditions, make things happen in ways that are less inimical than others. Of course (as with starting avalanches), it may not be clear what the right guiding nudge really is: ## Other Paths to the Singularity: Intelligence Amplification\nWhen people speak of creating superhumanly intelligent beings, they are usually imagining an AI project. But as I noted at the beginning of this paper, there are other paths to superhumanity. Computer networks and human-computer interfaces seem more mundane than AI, and yet they could lead to the Singularity. I call this contrasting approach Intelligence Amplification (IA). IA is something that is proceeding very naturally, in most cases not even recognized by its developers for what it is. But every time our ability to access information and to communicate it to others is improved, in some sense we have achieved an increase over natural intelligence. Even now, the team of a PhD human and good computer workstation (even an off-net workstation!) could probably max any written intelligence test in existence.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s very likely that IA is a much easier road to the achievement of superhumanity than pure AI. In humans, the hardest development problems have already been solved. Building up from within ourselves ought to be easier than figuring out first what we really are and then building machines that are all of that. And there is at least conjectural precedent for this approach. Cairns-Smith [5] has speculated that biological life may have begun as an adjunct to still more primitive life based on crystalline growth. Lynn Margulis [14] has made strong arguments for the view that mutualism is the great driving force in evolution.\nNote that I am not proposing that AI research be ignored or less funded. What goes on with AI will often have applications in IA, and vice versa. I am suggesting that we recognize that in network and interface research there is something as profound (and potential wild) as Artificial Intelligence. With that insight, we may see projects that are not as directly applicable as conventional interface and network design work, but which serve to advance us toward the Singularity along the IA path.\nHere are some possible projects that take on special significance, given the IA point of view:\nHuman/computer team automation: Take problems that are normally considered for purely machine solution (like hill-climbing problems), and design programs and interfaces that take a advantage of humans\u0026rsquo; intuition and available computer hardware. Considering all the bizarreness of higher dimensional hill-climbing problems (and the neat algorithms that have been devised for their solution), there could be some very interesting displays and control tools provided to the human team member. Develop human/computer symbiosis in art: Combine the graphic generation capability of modern machines and the esthetic sensibility of humans. Of course, there has been an enormous amount of research in designing computer aids for artists, as labor saving tools. I\u0026rsquo;m suggesting that we explicitly aim for a greater merging of competence, that we explicitly recognize the cooperative approach that is possible. Karl Sims [22] has done wonderful work in this direction. Allow human/computer teams at chess tournaments. We already have programs that can play better than almost all humans. But how much work has been done on how this power could be used by a human, to get something even better? If such teams were allowed in at least some chess tournaments, it could have the positive effect on IA research that allowing computers in tournaments had for the corresponding niche in AI. Develop interfaces that allow computer and network access without requiring the human to be tied to one spot, sitting in front of a computer. (This is an aspect of IA that fits so well with known economic advantages that lots of effort is already being spent on it.) Develop more symmetrical decision support systems. A popular research/product area in recent years has been decision support systems. This is a form of IA, but may be too focussed on systems that are oracular. As much as the program giving the user information, there must be the idea of the user giving the program guidance. Use local area nets to make human teams that really work (ie, are more effective than their component members). This is generally the area of \u0026ldquo;groupware\u0026rdquo;, already a very popular commercial pursuit. The change in viewpoint here would be to regard the group activity as a combination organism. In one sense, this suggestion might be regarded as the goal of inventing a \u0026ldquo;Rules of Order\u0026rdquo; for such combination operations. For instance, group focus might be more easily maintained than in classical meetings. Expertise of individual human members could be isolated from ego issues such that the contribution of different members is focussed on the team project. And of course shared data bases could be used much more conveniently than in conventional committee operations. (Note that this suggestion is aimed at team operations rather than political meetings. In a political setting, the automation described above would simply enforce the power of the persons making the rules!) Exploit the worldwide Internet as a combination human/machine tool. Of all the items on the list, progress in this is proceeding the fastest and may run us into the Singularity before anything else. The power and influence of even the present-day Internet is vastly underestimated. For instance, I think our contemporary computer systems would break under the weight of their own complexity if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the edge that the USENET \u0026ldquo;group mind\u0026rdquo; gives the system administration and support people!) The very anarchy of the worldwide net development is evidence of its potential. As connectivity and bandwidth and archive size and computer speed all increase, we are seeing something like Lynn Margulis\u0026rsquo; [14] vision of the biosphere as data processor recapitulated, but at a million times greater speed and with millions of humanly intelligent agents (ourselves). The above examples illustrate research that can be done within the context of contemporary computer science departments. There are other paradigms. For example, much of the work in Artificial Intelligence and neural nets would benefit from a closer connection with biological life. Instead of simply trying to model and understand biological life with computers, research could be directed toward the creation of composite systems that rely on biological life for guidance or for the providing features we don\u0026rsquo;t understand well enough yet to implement in hardware. A long-time dream of science-fiction has been direct brain to computer interfaces [2] [28]. In fact, there is concrete work that can be done (and has been done) in this area:\nLimb prosthetics is a topic of direct commercial applicability. Nerve to silicon transducers can be made [13]. This is an exciting, near-term step toward direct communcation. Similar direct links into brains may be feasible, if the bit rate is low: given human learning flexibility, the actual brain neuron targets might not have to be precisely selected. Even 100 bits per second would be of great use to stroke victims who would otherwise be confined to menu-driven interfaces. Plugging in to the optic trunk has the potential for bandwidths of 1 Mbit/second or so. But for this, we need to know the fine-scale architecture of vision, and we need to place an enormous web of electrodes with exquisite precision. If we want our high bandwidth connection to be in addition to what paths are already present in the brain, the problem becomes vastly more intractable. Just sticking a grid of high-bandwidth receivers into a brain certainly won\u0026rsquo;t do it. But suppose that the high-bandwidth grid were present while the brain structure was actually setting up, as the embryo develops. That suggests: Animal embryo experiments. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect any IA success in the first years of such research, but giving developing brains access to complex simulated neural structures might be very interesting to the people who study how the embryonic brain develops. In the long run, such experiments might produce animals with additional sense paths and interesting intellectual abilities. Originally, I had hoped that this discussion of IA would yield some clearly safer approaches to the Singularity. (After all, IA allows our participation in a kind of transcendance.) Alas, looking back over these IA proposals, about all I am sure of is that they should be considered, that they may give us more options. But as for safety \u0026hellip; well, some of the suggestions are a little scarey on their face. One of my informal reviewers pointed out that IA for individual humans creates a rather sinister elite. We humans have millions of years of evolutionary baggage that makes us regard competition in a deadly light. Much of that deadliness may not be necessary in today\u0026rsquo;s world, one where losers take on the winners\u0026rsquo; tricks and are coopted into the winners\u0026rsquo; enterprises. A creature that was built de novo might possibly be a much more benign entity than one with a kernel based on fang and talon. And even the egalitarian view of an Internet that wakes up along with all mankind can be viewed as a nightmare [25].\nThe problem is not that the Singularity represents simply the passing of humankind from center stange, but that it contradicts some of our most deeply held notions of being. I think a closer look at the notion of strong superhumanity can show why that is.\nStrong Superhumanity and the Best We Can Ask for # Suppose we could tailor the Singularity. Suppose we could attain our most extravagant hopes. What then would we ask for: That humans themselves would become their own successors, that whatever injustice occurs would be tempered by our knowledge of our roots. For those who remained unaltered, the goal would be benign treatment (perhaps even giving the stay-behinds the appearance of being masters of godlike slaves). It could be a golden age that also involved progress (overleaping Stent\u0026rsquo;s barrier). Immortality (or at least a lifetime as long as we can make the universe survive [9] [3]) would be achievable.\nBut in this brightest and kindest world, the philosophical problems themselves become intimidating. A mind that stays at the same capacity cannot live forever; after a few thousand years it would look more like a repeating tape loop than a person. (The most chilling picture I have seen of this is in [17].) To live indefinitely long, the mind itself must grow \u0026hellip; and when it becomes great enough, and looks back \u0026hellip; what fellow-feeling can it have with the soul that it was originally? Certainly the later being would be everything the original was, but so much vastly more. And so even for the individual, the Cairns-Smith (or Lynn Margulis) notion of new life growing incrementally out of the old must still be valid.\nThis \u0026ldquo;problem\u0026rdquo; about immortality comes up in much more direct ways. The notion of ego and self-awareness has been the bedrock of the hardheaded rationalism of the last few centuries. Yet now the notion of self-awareness is under attack from the Artificial Intelligence people (\u0026ldquo;self-awareness and other delusions\u0026rdquo;). Intelligence Amplification undercuts the importance of ego from another direction. The post-Singularity world will involve extremely high-bandwidth networking. A central feature of strongly superhuman entities will likely be their ability to communicate at variable bandwidths, including ones far higher than speech or written messages. What happens when pieces of ego can be copied and merged, when the size of a selfawareness can grow or shrink to fit the nature of the problems under consideration? These are essential features of strong superhumanity and the Singularity. Thinking about them, one begins to feel how essentially strange and different the Post-Human era will be — no matter how cleverly and benignly it is brought to be.\nFrom one angle, the vision fits many of our happiest dreams: a place unending, where we can truly know one another and understand the deepest mysteries. From another angle, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot like the worst case scenario I imagined earlier in this paper.\nWhich is the valid viewpoint? In fact, I think the new era is simply too different to fit into the classical frame of good and evil. That frame is based on the idea of isolated, immutable minds connected by tenuous, low-bandwith links. But the post-Singularity world does fit with the larger tradition of change and cooperation that started long ago (perhaps even before the rise of biological life). I think there are notions of ethics that would apply in such an era. Research into IA and high-bandwidth communications should improve this understanding. I see just the glimmerings of this now, in Good\u0026rsquo;s Meta-Golden Rule, perhaps in rules for distinguishing self from others on the basis of bandwidth of connection. And while mind and self will be vastly more labile than in the past, much of what we value (knowledge, memory, thought) need never be lost. I think Freeman Dyson has it right when he says [8]: \u0026ldquo;God is what mind becomes when it has passed beyond the scale of our comprehension.\u0026rdquo;\n[I wish to thank John Carroll of San Diego State University and Howard Davidson of Sun Microsystems for discussing the draft version of this paper with me.]\nAnnotated Sources [and an occasional plea for bibliographical help] # [1] Alfv�n, Hannes, writing as Olof Johanneson, The End of Man?, Award Books, 1969 earlier published as \u0026ldquo;The Tale of the Big Computer\u0026rdquo;, Coward-McCann, translated from a book copyright 1966 Albert Bonniers Forlag AB with English translation copyright 1966 by Victor Gollanz, Ltd.\n[2] Anderson, Poul, \u0026ldquo;Kings Who Die\u0026rdquo;, If, March 1962, p8-36.

He lay wailing upon the cold cave stones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He grew, steadily.\nInto his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The nightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew alert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright, insistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked about, blindly.\nThere was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared. And a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying face. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was crouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of his face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen night planet.\nSim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim pebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern entrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger, larger.\nThe man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were all that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his withered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\nThen, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the tunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\nTheir agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their faces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One minute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The next minute a desiccation and burning away of their flesh occurred.\nSim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed him, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her husband to rise again.\nWith a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the cave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her grasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist lungs!\nThe webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised. It was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still in his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants questions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended, ready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the dying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's new, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a newborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It was impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour now. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\nHis mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the weapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their conflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing harshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n\"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was, stretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon. \"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than us, and be young!\"\nThe father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring, eyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A girl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to procure food. His sister.\nThe mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up, weeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth trembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her husband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\nThe old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone crib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of her life's over, already,\" he gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\nAs Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured, smoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles. She was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling the knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the tunnel, was aging, dying.\nSim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to meet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his sister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers. He relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\nThe father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the child,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our last day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\nSim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\nThis was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the days were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The people lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of flame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong, and then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony, barren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset the day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable temperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns; all life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly, birds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal life rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get its living down in the brief hour of respite.\nIt was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours after birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire life in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone channels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep never, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\nAnd he would live exactly eight days.\n*****\nThe violence of this thought evacuated his bowels. Eight days. Eight short days. It was wrong, impossible, but a fact. Even while in his mother's flesh some racial knowledge had told him he was being formed rapidly, shaped and propelled out swiftly.\nBirth was quick as a knife. Childhood was over in a flash. Adolescence was a sheet of lightning. Manhood was a dream, maturity a myth, old age an inescapably quick reality, death a swift certainty.\nEight days from now he'd stand half-blind, withering, dying, as his father now stood, staring uselessly at his own wife and child.\nThis day was an eighth part of his total life! He must enjoy every second of it. He must search his parents' thoughts for knowledge.\nBecause in a few hours they'd be dead.\nThis was so impossibly unfair. Was this all of life? In his prenatal state hadn't he dreamed of long lives, valleys not of blasted stone but green foliage and temperate clime? Yes! And if he'd dreamed then there must be truth in the visions. How could he seek and find the long life? Where? And how could he accomplish a life mission that huge and depressing in eight short, vanishing days?\nHow had his people gotten into such a condition?\nAs if at a button pressed, he saw an image. Metal seeds, blown across space from a distant green world, fighting with long flames, crashing on this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls tumble men and women.\nWhen? Long ago. Ten thousand days. The crash victims hid in the cliffs from the sun. Fire, ice and floods washed away the wreckage of the huge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon a forge. Solar radiations drenched them. Their pulses quickened, two hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Their skins thickened, their blood changed. Old age came rushing. Children were born in the caves. Swifter, swifter, swifter the process. Like all this world's wild life, the men and women from the crash lived and died in a week, leaving children to do likewise.\nSo this is life, thought Sim. It was not spoken in his mind, for he knew no words, he knew only images, old memory, an awareness, a telepathy that could penetrate flesh, rock, metal. So I'm the five thousandth in a long line of futile sons? What can I do to save myself from dying eight days from now? Is there escape?\nHis eyes widened, another image came to focus.\nBeyond this valley of cliffs, on a low mountain lay a perfect, unscarred metal seed. A metal ship, not rusted or touched by the avalanches. The ship was deserted, whole, intact. It was the only ship of all these that had crashed that was still a unit, still usable. But it was so far away. There was no one in it to help. This ship, then, on the far mountain, was the destiny toward which he would grow. There was his only hope of escape.\nHis mind flexed.\nIn this cliff, deep down in a confinement of solitude, worked a handful of scientists. To these men, when he was old enough and wise enough, he must go. They, too, dreamed of escape, of long life, of green valleys and temperate weathers. They, too, stared longingly at that distant ship upon its high mountain, its metal so perfect it did not rust or age.\nThe cliff groaned.\nSim's father lifted his eroded, lifeless face.\n\"Dawn's coming,\" he said.\n*****\nII Morning relaxed the mighty granite cliff muscles. It was the time of the Avalanche.\nThe tunnels echoed to running bare feet. Adults, children pushed with eager, hungry eyes toward the outside dawn. From far out, Sim heard a rumble of rock, a scream, a silence. Avalanches fell into valley. Stones that had been biding their time, not quite ready to fall, for a million years let go their bulks, and where they had begun their journey as single boulders they smashed upon the valley floor in a thousand shrapnels and friction-heated nuggets.\nEvery morning at least one person was caught in the downpour.\nThe cliff people dared the avalanches. It added one more excitement to their lives, already too short, too headlong, too dangerous.\nSim felt himself seized up by his father. He was carried brusquely down the tunnel for a thousand yards, to where the daylight appeared. There was a shining insane light in his father's eyes. Sim could not move. He sensed what was going to happen. Behind his father, his mother hurried, bringing with her the little sister, Dark. \"Wait! Be careful!\" she cried to her husband.\nSim felt his father crouch, listening.\nHigh in the cliff was a tremor, a shivering.\n\"Now!\" bellowed his father, and leaped out.\nAn avalanche fell down at them!\nSim had accelerated impressions of plunging walls, dust, confusion. His mother screamed! There was a jolting, a plunging.\nWith one last step, Sim's father hurried him forward into the day. The avalanche thundered behind him. The mouth of the cave, where mother and Dark stood back out of the way, was choked with rubble and two boulders that weighed a hundred pounds each.\nThe storm thunder of the avalanche passed away to a trickle of sand. Sim's father burst out into laughter. \"Made it! By the Gods! Made it alive!\" And he looked scornfully at the cliff and spat. \"Pagh!\"\nMother and sister Dark struggled through the rubble. She cursed her husband. \"Fool! You might have killed Sim!\"\n\"I may yet,\" retorted the father.\nSim was not listening. He was fascinated with the remains of an avalanche afront of the next tunnel. A blood stain trickled out from under a rise of boulders, soaking into the ground. There was nothing else to be seen. Someone else had lost the game.\nDark ran ahead on lithe, supple feet, naked and certain.\nThe valley air was like a wine filtered between mountains. The heaven was a restive blue; not the pale scorched atmosphere of full day, nor the bloated, bruised black-purple of night, a-riot with sickly shining stars.\nThis was a tide pool. A place where waves of varying and violent temperatures struck, receded. Now the tide pool was quiet, cool, and its life moved abroad.\nLaughter! Far away, Sim heard it. Why laughter? How could any of his people find time for laughing? Perhaps later he would discover why.\nThe valley suddenly blushed with impulsive color. Plant-life, thawing in the precipitant dawn, shoved out from most unexpected sources. It flowered as you watched. Pale green tendrils appeared on scoured rocks. Seconds later, ripe globes of fruit twitched upon the blade-tips. Father gave Sim over to mother and harvested the momentary, volatile crop, thrust scarlet, blue, yellow fruits into a fur sack which hung at his waist. Mother tugged at the moist new grasses, laid them on Sim's tongue.\nHis senses were being honed to a fine edge. He stored knowledge thirstily. He understood love, marriage, customs, anger, pity, rage, selfishness, shadings and subtleties, realities and reflections. One thing suggested another. The sight of green plant life whirled his mind like a gyroscope, seeking balance in a world where lack of time for explanations made a mind seek and interpret on its own. The soft burden of food gave him knowledge of his system, of energy, of movement. Like a bird newly cracking its way from a shell, he was almost a unit, complete, all-knowing. Heredity had done all this for him. He grew excited with his ability.\n*****\nThey walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells, watching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like scurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing:\n\"Remember?\"\nRemember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember when they'd lived only seven days!\nThe husband and wife looked at each other.\n\"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her eyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She sobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips. The wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago it was you!\"\n\"An hour is half a life.\"\n\"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because it will be our last looking.\"\n\"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn back now.\"\n\"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman.\n\"The sun will catch us.\"\n\"Let it catch me then!\"\n\"You don't mean that.\"\n\"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman.\nThe sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing wind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered battlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those avalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like mantles.\n\"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the valley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of green fruits, she joined them.\nThe sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously with it, and whistled.\nThe cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children, bearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep hideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child someone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he was not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from the cliffs even as he was half across the valley.\nFlowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like singed snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace blast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at sunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.\nSim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of the valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of their tunnel.\n\"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not a good thing to watch.\"\nThey turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of metal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred. Far away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space reflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his intra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged, lying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope for survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he was—strange thought—a grown man!\nThe sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.\nThe little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming stopped.\nSim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel, paused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during the night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will drink one last toast. To you, to the children.\"\n\"To you,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the icicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths.\n*****\nAll day the sun seemed to blaze and erupt into the valley. Sim could not see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were sufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like mercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never penetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of the cliff comfortably warm.\nSim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought with mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father seemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what will happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\nSim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements of his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing, feeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was love. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a smell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him, the look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes, then searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her brain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing him, rushing him along toward oblivion.\nHe sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his cells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and sinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at birth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant later, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned in a million crevices of thought and discovery.\nHis sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children, forever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no appetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n\"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\nThe day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\nHis mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just once more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\nHis father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n\"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n\"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was handed to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She gave Sim one last fondling touch.\nDark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n\"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy yourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\nDark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp, looking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out and somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n\"Why...?\"\nHe saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n\"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n\"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\nThe last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly, swayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent husband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n*****\nIV The night came and passed and then started the second day.\nThe bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a funeral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long, the bodies numerous.\nDark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one hand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\nAt the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed. Nobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason? Was it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get to it and fly away into space?\nThe funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground where the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\nThe procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their few minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet air.\nDark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged what they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third. They were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\nAnother piece of his life opened wide.\nFifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock daggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant black, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n\"War!\"\nThe thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men were running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs where other people lived.\nBut why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\nFrom a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his stomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\nDark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there was the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching Dark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue, forever hungry.\nPale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up the rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious red berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\nThe child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then Sim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous jumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\nSim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should not be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\nDark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried. \"What's your name, bad one?\"\n\"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\nSim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled features. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited for an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood the avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these were things of places, of scene—mute, extravagant manifestations of unthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here, now, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\nChion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n\"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\nAnd he vanished around a rock.\nMore children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends, enemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible, quick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\nDark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for desired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made over things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends. Enemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've made an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\" And she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing older before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself. Others, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a ridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of the life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You see? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\nBut Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who tomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain breasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small girl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\nShe ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as silver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a love, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral pyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\nOnly the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n\"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n\"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n\"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n\"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\nDark nudged his ribs. \"Here, eat,\" she said to the distracted boy. \"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\nFrom nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing malevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\nDark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of hair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need weapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry—the sun's coming!\"\nThey ran back to the caves.\n*****\nOne-fourth of his life was over! Babyhood was gone. He was now a young boy! Wild rains lashed the valley at nightfall. He watched new river channels cut in the valley, out past the mountain of the metal seed. He stored the knowledge for later use. Each night there was a new river, a bed newly cut.\n\"What's beyond the valley?\" wondered Sim.\n\"No one's ever been beyond it,\" explained Dark. \"All who tried to reach the plain were frozen to death or burnt. The only land we know's within half an hour's run. Half an hour out and half an hour back.\"\n\"No one has ever reached the metal seed, then?\"\nDark scoffed. \"The Scientists, they try. Silly fools. They don't know enough to stop. It's no use. It's too far.\"\nThe Scientists. The word stirred him. He had almost forgotten the vision he had short hours after birth. His voice was eager. \"Where are the Scientists?\" he demanded.\nDark looked away from him, \"I wouldn't tell you if I knew. They'd kill you, experimenting! I don't want you joining them! Live your life, don't cut it in half trying to reach that silly metal thing on the mountain.\"\n\"I'll find out where they are from someone else, then!\"\n\"No one'll tell you! They hate the Scientists. You'll have to find them on your own. And then what? Will you save us? Yes, save us, little boy!\" Her face was sullen; already half her life was gone, her breasts were beginning to shape. Tomorrow she must divine how best to live her youth, her love, and she knew no way to fully plumb the depths of passion in so short a space.\n\"We can't sit and talk and eat,\" he protested. \"And nothing else.\"\n\"There's always love,\" she retorted acidly. \"It helps one forget. Gods, yes,\" she spat it out. \"Love!\"\n*****\nSim ran through the tunnels, seeking. Sometimes he half imagined where the Scientists were. But then a flood of angry thought from those around him, when he asked the direction to the Scientists' cave, washed over him in confusion and resentment. After all, it was the Scientists' fault that they had been placed upon this terrible world! Sim flinched under the bombardment of oaths and curses.\nQuietly he took his seat in a central chamber with the children to listen to the grown men talk. This was the time of education, the Time of Talking. No matter how he chafed at delay, or how great his impatience, even though life slipped fast from him and death approached like a black meteor, he knew his mind needed knowledge. Tonight, then, was the night of school. But he sat uneasily. Only five more days of life.\nChion sat across from Sim, his thin-mouthed face arrogant.\nLyte appeared between the two. The last few hours had made her firmer footed, gentler, taller. Her hair shone brighter. She smiled as she sat beside Sim, ignoring Chion. And Chion became rigid at this and ceased eating.\nThe dialogue crackled, filled the room. Swift as heart beats, one thousand, two thousand words a minute. Sim learned, his head filled. He did not shut his eyes, but lapsed into a kind of dreaming that was almost intra-embryonic in lassitude and drowsy vividness. In the faint background the words were spoken, and they wove a tapestry of knowledge in his head.\n*****\nHe dreamed of green meadows free of stones, all grass, round and rolling and rushing easily toward a dawn with no taint of freezing, merciless cold or smell of boiled rock or scorched monument. He walked across the green meadow. Overhead the metal seeds flew by in a heaven that was a steady, even temperature. Things were slow, slow, slow.\nBirds lingered upon gigantic trees that took a hundred, two hundred, five thousand days to grow. Everything remained in its place, the birds did not flicker nervously at a hint of sun, nor did the trees suck back frightenedly when a ray of sunlight poured over them.\nIn this dream people strolled, they rarely ran, the heart rhythm of them was evenly languid, not jerking and insane. Their kisses were long and lingering, not the parched mouthings and twitchings of lovers who had eight days to live. The grass remained, and did not burn away in torches. The dream people talked always of tomorrow and living and not tomorrow and dying. It all seemed so familiar that when Sim felt someone take his hand he thought it simply another part of the dream.\nLyte's hand lay inside his own. \"Dreaming?\" she asked.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Things are balanced. Our minds, to even things, to balance the unfairness of our living, go back in on ourselves, to find what there is that is good to see.\"\nHe beat his hand against the stone floor again and again. \"It does not make things fair! I hate it! It reminds me that there is something better, something I have missed! Why can't we be ignorant! Why can't we live and die without knowing that this is an abnormal living?\" And his breath rushed harshly from his half-open, constricted mouth.\n\"There is purpose in everything,\" said Lyte. \"This gives us purpose, makes us work, plan, try to find a way.\"\nHis eyes were hot emeralds in his face. \"I walked up a hill of grass, very slowly,\" he said.\n\"The same hill of grass I walked an hour ago?\" asked Lyte.\n\"Perhaps. Close enough to it. The dream is better than the reality.\" He flexed his eyes, narrowed them. \"I watched people and they did not eat.\"\n\"Or talk?\"\n\"Or talk, either. And we always are eating, always talking. Sometimes those people in the dream sprawled with their eyes shut, not moving a muscle.\"\nAs Lyte stared down into his face a terrible thing happened. He imagined her face blackening, wrinkling, twisting into knots of agedness. The hair blew out like snow about her ears, the eyes were like discolored coins caught in a web of lashes. Her teeth sank away from her lips, the delicate fingers hung like charred twigs from her atrophied wrists. Her beauty was consumed and wasted even as he watched, and when he seized her, in terror, he cried out, for he imagined his own hand corroded, and he choked back a cry.\n\"Sim, what's wrong?\"\nThe saliva in his mouth dried at the taste of the words.\n\"Five more days....\"\n\"The Scientists.\"\nSim started. Who'd spoken? In the dim light a tall man talked. \"The Scientists crashed us on this world, and now have wasted thousands of lives and time. It's no use. It's no use. Tolerate them but give them none of your time. You only live once, remember.\"\nWhere were these hated Scientists? Now, after the Learning, the Time of Talking, he was ready to find them. Now, at least, he knew enough to begin his fight for freedom, for the ship!\n\"Sim, where're you going?\"\nBut Sim was gone. The echo of his running feet died away down a shaft of polished stone.\n*****\nIt seemed that half the night was wasted. He blundered into a dozen dead ends. Many times he was attacked by the insane young men who wanted his life energy. Their superstitious ravings echoed after him. The gashes of their hungry fingernails covered his body.\nHe found what he looked for.\nA half dozen men gathered in a small basalt cave deep down in the cliff lode. On a table before them lay objects which, though unfamiliar, struck harmonious chords in Sim.\nThe Scientists worked in sets, old men doing important work, young men learning, asking questions; and at their feet were three small children. They were a process. Every eight days there was an entirely new set of scientists working on any one problem. The amount of work done was terribly inadequate. They grew old, fell dead just when they were beginning their creative period. The creative time of any one individual was perhaps a matter of twelve hours out of his entire span. Three-quarters of one's life was spent learning, a brief interval of creative power, then senility, insanity, death.\nThe men turned as Sim entered.\n\"Don't tell me we have a recruit?\" said the eldest of them.\n\"I don't believe it,\" said another, younger one. \"Chase him away. He's probably one of those war-mongers.\"\n\"No, no,\" objected the elder one, moving with little shuffles of his bare feet toward Sim. \"Come in, come in, boy.\" He had friendly eyes, slow eyes, unlike those of the swift inhabitants of the upper caves. Grey and quiet. \"What do you want?\"\nSim hesitated, lowered his head, unable to meet the quiet, gentle gaze. \"I want to live,\" he whispered.\nThe old man laughed quietly. He touched Sim's shoulder. \"Are you a new breed? Are you sick?\" he queried of Sim, half-seriously. \"Why aren't you playing? Why aren't you readying yourself for the time of love and marriage and children? Don't you know that tomorrow night you'll be an adolescent? Don't you realize that if you are not careful you'll miss all of life?\" He stopped.\nSim moved his eyes back and forth with each query. He blinked at the instruments on the table top. \"Shouldn't I be here?\" he asked, naively.\n\"Certainly,\" roared the old man, sternly. \"But it's a miracle you are. We've had no volunteers from the rank and file for a thousand days! We've had to breed our own scientists, a closed unit! Count us! Six! Six men! And three children! Are we not overwhelming?\" The old man spat upon the stone floor. \"We ask for volunteers and the people shout back at us, 'Get someone else!' or 'We have no time!' And you know why they say that?\"\n\"No.\" Sim flinched.\n\"Because they're selfish. They'd like to live longer, yes, but they know that anything they do cannot possibly insure their own lives any extra time. It might guarantee longer life to some future offspring of theirs. But they won't give up their love, their brief youth, give up one interval of sunset or sunrise!\"\nSim leaned against the table, earnestly. \"I understand.\"\n\"You do?\" The old man stared at him blindly. He sighed and slapped the child's thigh, gently. \"Yes, of course, you do. It's too much to expect anyone to understand, any more. You're rare.\"\nThe others moved in around Sim and the old man.\n\"I am Dienc. Tomorrow night Cort here will be in my place. I'll be dead by then. And the night after that someone else will be in Cort's place, and then you, if you work and believe—but first, I give you a chance. Return to your playmates if you want. There is someone you love? Return to her. Life is short. Why should you care for the unborn to come? You have a right to youth. Go now, if you want. Because if you stay you'll have no time for anything but working and growing old and dying at your work. But it is good work. Well?\"\nSim looked at the tunnel. From a distance the wind roared and blew, the smells of cooking and the patter of naked feet sounded, and the laughter of lovers was an increasingly good thing to hear. He shook his head, impatiently, and his eyes were wet.\n\"I will stay,\" he said.\n*****\nVI The third night and third day passed. It was the fourth night. Sim was drawn into their living. He learned about that metal seed upon the top of the far mountain. He heard of the original seeds—things called \"ships\" that crashed and how the survivors hid and dug in the cliffs, grew old swiftly and in their scrabbling to barely survive, forgot all science. Knowledge of mechanical things had no chance of survival in such a volcanic civilization. There was only NOW for each human.\nYesterday didn't matter, tomorrow stared them vividly in their very faces. But somehow the radiations that had forced their aging had also induced a kind of telepathic communication whereby philosophies and impressions were absorbed by the new born. Racial memory, growing instinctively, preserved memories of another time.\n\"Why don't we go to that ship on the mountain?\" asked Sim.\n\"It is too far. We would need protection from the sun,\" explained Dienc.\n\"Have you tried to make protection?\"\n\"Salves and ointments, suits of stone and bird-wing and, recently, crude metals. None of which worked. In ten thousand more life times perhaps we'll have made a metal in which will flow cool water to protect us on the march to the ship. But we work so slowly, so blindly. This morning, mature, I took up my instruments. Tomorrow, dying, I lay them down. What can one man do in one day? If we had ten thousand men, the problem would be solved....\"\n\"I will go to the ship,\" said Sim.\n\"Then you will die,\" said the old man. A silence had fallen on the room at Sim's words. Then the men stared at Sim. \"You are a very selfish boy.\"\n\"Selfish!\" cried Sim, resentfully.\nThe old man patted the air. \"Selfish in a way I like. You want to live longer, you'll do anything for that. You will try for the ship. But I tell you it is useless. Yet, if you want to, I cannot stop you. At least you will not be like those among us who go to war for an extra few days of life.\"\n\"War?\" asked Sim. \"How can there be war here?\"\nAnd a shudder ran through him. He did not understand.\n\"Tomorrow will be time enough for that,\" said Dienc. \"Listen to me, now.\"\nThe night passed.\n*****\nVII It was morning. Lyte came shouting and sobbing down a corridor, and ran full into his arms. She had changed again. She was older, again, more beautiful. She was shaking and she held to him. \"Sim, they're coming after you!\"\nBare feet marched down the corridor, surged inward at the opening. Chion stood grinning there, taller, too, a sharp rock in either of his hands. \"Oh, there you are, Sim!\"\n\"Go away!\" cried Lyte savagely whirling on him.\n\"Not until we take Sim with us,\" Chion assured her. Then, smiling at Sim. \"If that is, he is with us in the fight.\"\nDienc shuffled forward, his eye weakly fluttering, his bird-like hands fumbling in the air. \"Leave!\" he shrilled angrily. \"This boy is a Scientist now. He works with us.\"\nChion ceased smiling. \"There is better work to be done. We go now to fight the people in the farthest cliffs.\" His eyes glittered anxiously. \"Of course, you will come with us, Sim?\"\n\"No, no!\" Lyte clutched at his arm.\nSim patted her shoulder, then turned to Chion. \"Why are you attacking these people?\"\n\"There are three extra days for those who go with us to fight.\"\n\"Three extra days! Of living?\"\nChion nodded firmly. \"If we win, we live eleven days instead of eight. The cliffs they live in, something about the mineral in it! Think of it, Sim, three long, good days of life. Will you join us?\"\nDienc interrupted. \"Get along without him. Sim is my pupil!\"\nChion snorted. \"Go die, old man. By sunset tonight you'll be charred bone. Who are you to order us? We are young, we want to live longer.\"\nEleven days. The words were unbelievable to Sim. Eleven days. Now he understood why there was war. Who wouldn't fight to have his life lengthened by almost half its total. So many more days of youth and love and seeing and living! Yes. Why not, indeed!\n\"Three extra days,\" called Dienc, stridently, \"if you live to enjoy them. If you're not killed in battle. If. If! You have never won yet. You have always lost!\"\n\"But this time,\" Chion declared sharply, \"We'll win!\"\nSim was bewildered. \"But we are all of the same ancestors. Why don't we all share the best cliffs?\"\nChion laughed and adjusted a sharp stone in his hand. \"Those who live in the best cliffs think they are better than us. That is always man's attitude when he has power. The cliffs there, besides, are smaller, there's room for only three hundred people in them.\"\nThree extra days.\n\"I'll go with you,\" Sim said to Chion.\n\"Fine!\" Chion was very glad, much too glad at the decision.\nDienc gasped.\nSim turned to Dienc and Lyte. \"If I fight, and win, I will be half a mile closer to the Ship. And I'll have three extra days in which to strive to reach the Ship. That seems the only thing for me to do.\"\nDienc nodded, sadly. \"It is the only thing. I believe you. Go along now.\"\n\"Good-bye,\" said Sim.\nThe old man looked surprised, then he laughed as at a little joke on himself. \"That's right—I won't see you again, will I? Good-bye, then.\" And they shook hands.\nThey went out, Chion, Sim, and Lyte, together, followed by the others, all children growing swiftly into fighting men. And the light in Chion's eyes was not a good thing to see.\n*****\nLyte went with him. She chose his rocks for him and carried them. She would not go back, no matter how he pleaded. The sun was just beyond the horizon and they marched across the valley.\n\"Please, Lyte, go back!\"\n\"And wait for Chion to return?\" she said. \"He plans that when you die I will be his mate.\" She shook out her unbelievable blue-white curls of hair defiantly. \"But I'll be with you. If you fall, I fall.\"\nSim's face hardened. He was tall. The world had shrunk during the night. Children packs screamed by hilarious in their food-searching and he looked at them with alien wonder: could it be only four days ago he'd been like these? Strange. There was a sense of many days in his mind, as if he'd really lived a thousand days. There was a dimension of incident and thought so thick, so multi-colored, so richly diverse in his head that it was not to be believed so much could happen in so short a time.\nThe fighting men ran in clusters of two or three. Sim looked ahead at the rising line of small ebon cliffs. This, then, he said to himself, is my fourth day. And still I am no closer to the Ship, or to anything, not even—he heard the light tread of Lyte beside him—not even to her who bears my weapons and picks me ripe berries.\nOne-half of his life was gone. Or a third of it—IF he won this battle. If.\nHe ran easily, lifting, letting fall his legs. This is the day of my physical awareness, as I run I feed, as I feed I grow and as I grow I turn eyes to Lyte with a kind of dizzying vertigo. And she looks upon me with the same gentleness of thought. This is the day of our youth. Are we wasting it? Are we losing it on a dream, a folly?\nDistantly he heard laughter. As a child he'd questioned it. Now he understood laughter. This particular laughter was made of climbing high rocks and plucking the greenest blades and drinking the headiest vintage from the morning ices and eating of the rock-fruits and tasting of young lips in new appetite.\nThey neared the cliffs of the enemy.\nHe saw the slender erectness of Lyte. The new surprise of her white breasts; the neck where if you touched you could time her pulse; the fingers which cupped in your own were animate and supple and never still; the....\nLyte snapped her head to one side. \"Look ahead!\" she cried. \"See what is to come—look only ahead.\"\nHe felt that they were racing by part of their lives, leaving their youth on the pathside, without so much as a glance.\n\"I am blind with looking at stones,\" he said, running.\n\"Find new stones, then!\"\n\"I see stones—\" His voice grew gentle as the palm of her hand. The landscape floated under him. Everything was like a fine wind, blowing dreamily. \"I see stones that make a ravine that lies in a cool shadow where the stone-berries are thick as tears. You touch a boulder and the berries fall in silent red avalanches, and the grass is very tender....\"\n\"I do not see it!\" She increased her pace, turning her head away.\nHe saw the floss upon her neck, like the small moss that grows silvery and light on the cool side of pebbles, that stirs if you breathe the lightest breath upon it. He looked upon himself, his hands clenched as he heaved himself forward toward death. Already his hands were veined and youth-swollen.\nThey were the hands of a young boy whose fingers are made for touching, which are suddenly sensitive and with more surface, and are nervous, and seem not a part of him because they are so big for the slender lengths of his arms. His neck, through which the blood ached and pumped, was building out with age, too, with tiny blue tendrils of veins imbedded and flaring in it.\nLyte handed him food to eat.\n\"I am not hungry,\" he said.\n\"Eat, keep your mouth full,\" she commanded sharply. \"So you will not talk to me this way!\"\n\"If I could only kiss you,\" he pleaded. \"Just one time.\"\n\"After the battle there may be time.\"\n\"Gods!\" He roared, anguished. \"Who cares for battles!\"\nAhead of them, rocks hailed down, thudding. A man fell with his skull split wide. The war was begun.\nLyte passed the weapons to him. They ran without another word until they entered the killing ground. Then he spoke, not looking at her, his cheeks coloring. \"Thank you,\" he said.\nShe ducked as a slung stone shot by her head. \"It was not an easy thing for me,\" she admitted. \"Sim! Be careful!\"\nThe boulders began to roll in a synthetic avalanche from the battlements of the enemy!\n*****\nOnly one thought was in his mind now. To kill, to lessen the life of someone else so he could live, to gain a foothold here and live long enough to make a stab at the ship. He ducked, he weaved, he clutched stones and hurled them up. His left hand held a flat stone shield with which he diverted the swiftly plummeting rocks. There was a spatting sound everywhere. Lyte ran with him, encouraging him. Two men dropped before him, slain, their breasts cleaved to the bone, their blood springing out in unbelievable founts.\nIt was a useless conflict. Sim realized instantly how insane the venture was. They could never storm the cliff. A solid wall of rocks rained down. A dozen men dropped with shards of ebony in their brains, a half dozen more showed drooping, broken arms. One screamed and the upthrust white joint of his knee was exposed as the flesh was pulled away by two successive blows of well-aimed granite. Men stumbled over one another.\nThe muscles in his cheeks pulled tight and he began to wonder why he had ever come. But his raised eyes, as he danced from side to side, weaving and bobbing, sought always the cliffs. He wanted to live there so intensely, to have his chance. He would have to stick it out. But the heart was gone from him.\nLyte screamed piercingly. Sim, his heart panicking, twisted and saw that her hand was loose at the wrist, with an ugly wound bleeding profusely on the back of the knuckles. She clamped it under her armpit to soothe the pain. The anger rose in him and exploded. In his fury he raced forward, throwing his missiles with deadly accuracy. He saw a man topple and flail down, falling from one level to another of the caves, a victim of his shot. He must have been screaming, for his lungs were bursting open and closed and his throat was raw, and the ground spun madly under his racing feet.\nThe stone that clipped his head sent him reeling and plunging back. He ate sand. The universe dissolved into purple whorls. He could not get up. He lay and knew that this was his last day, his last time. The battle raged around him, dimly he felt Lyte over him. Her hands cooled his head, she tried to drag him out of range, but he lay gasping and telling her to leave him.\n\"Stop!\" shouted a voice. The whole war seemed to give pause. \"Retreat!\" commanded the voice swiftly. And as Sim watched, lying upon his side, his comrades turned and fled back toward home.\n\"The sun is coming, our time is up!\" He saw their muscled backs, their moving, tensing, flickering legs go up and down. The dead were left upon the field. The wounded cried for help. But there was no time for the wounded. There was only time for swift men to run the gauntlet home and, their lungs aching and raw with heated air, burst into their tunnels before the sun burnt and killed them.\nThe sun!\nSim saw another figure racing toward him. It was Chion! Lyte was helping Sim to his feet, whispering helpfully to him. \"Can you walk?\" she asked. And he groaned and said, \"I think so.\" \"Walk then,\" she said. \"Walk slowly, and then faster and faster. We'll make it. Walk slowly, start carefully. We'll make it, I know we will.\"\nSim got to his feet, stood swaying. Chion raced up, a strange expression cutting lines in his cheeks, his eyes shining with battle. Pushing Lyte abruptly aside he seized upon a rock and dealt Sim a jolting blow upon his ankle that laid wide the flesh. All of this was done quite silently.\nNow he stood back, still not speaking, grinning like an animal from the night mountains, his chest panting in and out, looking from the thing he had done, to Lyte, and back. He got his breath. \"He'll never make it,\" he nodded at Sim. \"We'll have to leave him here. Come along, Lyte.\"\nLyte, like a cat-animal, sprang upon Chion, searching for his eyes, shrieking through her exposed, hard-pressed teeth. Her fingers stroked great bloody furrows down Chion's arms and again, instantly, down his neck. Chion, with an oath, sprang away from her. She hurled a rock at him. Grunting, he let it miss him, then ran off a few yards. \"Fool!\" he cried, turning to scorn her. \"Come along with me. Sim will be dead in a few minutes. Come along!\"\nLyte turned her back on him. \"I will go if you carry me.\"\nChion's face changed. His eyes lost their gleaming. \"There is no time. We would both die if I carried you.\"\nLyte looked through and beyond him. \"Carry me, then, for that's how I wish it to be.\"\nWithout another word, glancing fearfully at the sun, Chion fled. His footsteps sped away and vanished from hearing. \"May he fall and break his neck,\" whispered Lyte, savagely glaring at his form as it skirted a ravine. She returned to Sim. \"Can you walk?\"\n*****\nAgonies of pain shot up his leg from the wounded ankle. He nodded ironically. \"We could make it to the cave in two hours, walking. I have an idea, Lyte. Carry me.\" And he smiled with the grim joke.\nShe took his arm. \"Nevertheless we'll walk. Come.\"\n\"No,\" he said. \"We're staying here.\"\n\"But why?\"\n\"We came to seek a home here. If we walk we will die. I would rather die here. How much time have we?\"\nTogether they measured the sun. \"A few minutes,\" she said, her voice flat and dull. She held close to him.\nHe looked at her. Lyte, he thought. Tomorrow I would have been a man. My body would have been strong and full and there would have been time with you, a kissing and a touching. Damn, but what kind of life is this where every last instant is drenched with fear and alert with death? Am I to be denied even some bit of real life?\nThe black rocks of the cliff were paling into deep purples and browns as the sun began to flood the world.\nWhat a fool he was! He should have stayed and worked with Dienc, and thought and dreamed, and at least one time cupped Lyte's mouth with his own.\nWith the sinews of his neck standing out defiantly he bellowed upward at the cliff holes.\n\"Send me down one man to do battle!\"\nSilence. His voice echoed from the cliff. The air was warm.\n\"It's no use,\" said Lyte, \"They'll pay no attention.\"\nHe shouted again. \"Hear me!\" He stood with his weight on his good foot, his injured left leg throbbing and pulsating with pain. He shook a fist. \"Send down a warrior who is no coward! I will not turn and run home! I have come to fight a fair fight! Send a man who will fight for the right to his cave! Him I will surely kill!\"\nMore silence. A wave of heat passed over the land, receded.\n\"Oh, surely,\" mocked Sim, hands on naked hips, head back, mouth wide, \"surely there's one among you not afraid to fight a cripple!\" Silence. \"No?\" Silence.\n\"Then I have miscalculated you. I'm wrong. I'll stand here, then, until the sun shucks the flesh off my bone in black scraps, and call you the filthy names you deserve.\"\nHe got an answer.\n\"I do not like being called names,\" replied a man's voice.\nSim leaned forward, forgetting his crippled foot.\nA huge man appeared in a cave mouth on the third level.\n\"Come down,\" urged Sim. \"Come down, fat one, and kill me.\"\nThe man scowled seriously at his opponent a moment, then lumbered slowly down the path, his hands empty of any weapons. Immediately every cave above clustered with heads. An audience for this drama.\nThe man approached Sim. \"We will fight by the rules, if you know them.\"\n\"I'll learn as we go,\" replied Sim.\nThis pleased the man and he looked at Sim warily, but not unkindly. \"This much I will tell you,\" offered the man generously. \"If you die, I will give your mate shelter and she will live, as she pleases, because she is the wife of a good man.\"\nSim nodded swiftly. \"I am ready,\" he said.\n\"The rules are simple. We do not touch each other, save with stones. The stones and the sun will do either of us in. Now is the time—\"\n*****\nVIII A tip of the sun showed on the horizon. \"My name is Nhoj,\" said Sim's enemy, casually fingering up a handful of pebbles and stones, weighing them. Sim did likewise. He was hungry. He had not eaten for many minutes. Hunger was the curse of this planet's peoples—a perpetual demanding of empty stomachs for more, more food. His blood flushed weakly, shot tinglingly through veins in jolting throbs of heat and pressure, his ribcase shoved out, went in, shoved out again, impatiently.\n\"Now!\" roared the three hundred watchers from the cliffs. \"Now!\" they clamored, the men and women and children balanced, in turmoil on the ledges. \"Now! Begin!\"\nAs if at a cue, the sun leaped high. It smote them a blow as with a flat, sizzling stone. The two men staggered under the molten impact, sweat broke from their naked thighs and loins, under their arms and on their faces was a glaze like fine glass.\nNhoj shifted his huge weight and looked at the sun as if in no hurry to fight. Then, silently, with no warning, he kanurcked out a pebble with a startling trigger-flick of thumb and forefinger. It caught Sim flat on the cheek, staggered him back, so that a rocket of unbearable pain climbed up his crippled foot and burst into nervous explosion at the pit of his stomach. He tasted blood from his bleeding cheek.\nNhoj moved serenely. Three more flickers of his magical hands and three tiny, seemingly harmless bits of stone flew like whistling birds. Each of them found a target, slammed it. The nerve centers of Sim's body! One hit his stomach so that ten hours' eating almost slid up his throat. A second got his forehead, a third his neck. He collapsed to the boiling sand. His knee made a wrenching sound on the hard earth. His face was colorless and his eyes, squeezed tight, were pushing tears out from the hot, quivering lids. But even as he had fallen he had let loose, with wild force, his handful of stones!\nThe stones purred in the air. One of them, and only one, struck Nhoj. Upon the left eyeball. Nhoj moaned and laid his hands in the next instant to his shattered eye.\nSim choked out a bitter, sighing laugh. This much triumph he had. The eye of his opponent. It would give him ... Time. Oh, gods, he thought, his stomach retching sickly, fighting for breath, this is a world of time. Give me a little more, just a trifle!\nNhoj, one-eyed, weaving with pain, pelted the writhing body of Sim, but his aim was off now, the stones flew to one side or if they struck at all they were weak and spent and lifeless.\nSim forced himself half erect. From the corners of his eyes he saw Lyte, waiting, staring at him, her lips breathing words of encouragement and hope. He was bathed in sweat, as if a rain spray had showered him down.\n*****\nThe sun was now fully over the horizon. You could smell it. Stones glinted like mirrors, the sand began to roil and bubble. Illusions sprang up everywhere in the valley. Instead of one warrior Nhoj he was confronted by a dozen, each in an upright position, preparing to launch another missile. A dozen irregular warriors who shimmered in the golden menace of day, like bronze gongs smitten, quivered in one vision!\nSim was breathing desperately. His nostrils flared and sucked and his mouth drank thirstily of flame instead of oxygen. His lungs took fire like silk torches and his body was consumed. The sweat spilled from his pores to be instantly evaporated. He felt himself shriveling, shriveling in on himself, he imagined himself looking like his father, old, sunken, slight, withered! Where was the sand? Could he move? Yes. The world wriggled under him, but now he was on his feet.\nThere would be no more fighting.\nA murmur from the cliff told this. The sunburnt faces of the high audience gaped and jeered and shouted encouragement to their warrior. \"Stand straight, Nhoj, save your strength now! Stand tall and perspire!\" they urged him. And Nhoj stood, swaying lightly, swaying slowly, a pendulum in an incandescent fiery breath from the skyline. \"Don't move, Nhoj, save your heart, save your power!\"\n\"The Test, The Test!\" said the people on the heights. \"The test of the sun.\"\nAnd this was the worst part of the fight. Sim squinted painfully at the distorted illusion of cliff. He thought he saw his parents; father with his defeated face, his green eyes burning, mother with her hair blowing like a cloud of grey smoke in the fire wind. He must get up to them, live for and with them!\nBehind him, Sim heard Lyte whimper softly. There was a whisper of flesh against sand. She had fallen. He did not dare turn. The strength of turning would bring him thundering down in pain and darkness.\nHis knees bent. If I fall, he thought, I'll lie here and become ashes. Where was Nhoj? Nhoj was there, a few yards from him, standing bent, slick with perspiration, looking as if he were being hit over the spine with great hammers of destruction.\n\"Fall, Nhoj! Fall!\" screamed Sim, mentally. \"Fall, fall! Fall and die so I can take your place!\"\nBut Nhoj did not fall. One by one the pebbles in his half-loose left hand plummeted to the broiling sands and Nhoj's lips peeled back, the saliva burned away from his lips and his eyes glazed. But he did not fall. The will to live was strong in him. He hung as if by a wire.\nSim fell to one knee!\n\"Ahh!\" wailed the knowing voices from the cliff. They were watching death. Sim jerked his head up, smiling mechanically, foolishly as if caught in the act of doing something silly. \"No, no,\" he insisted drowsily, and got back up again. There was so much pain he was all one ringing numbness. A whirring, buzzing, frying sound filled the land. High up, an avalanche came down like a curtain on a drama, making no noise. Everything was quiet except for a steady humming. He saw fifty images of Nhoj now, dressed in armours of sweat, eyes puffed with torture, cheeks sunken, lips peeled back like the rind of a drying fruit. But the wire still held him.\n\"Now,\" muttered Sim, sluggishly, with a thick, baked tongue between his blazing teeth. \"Now I'll fall and lie and dream.\" He said it with slow, thoughtful pleasure. He planned it. He knew how it must be done. He would do it accurately. He lifted his head to see if the audience was watching.\nThey were gone!\nThe sun had driven them back in. All save one or two brave ones. Sim laughed drunkenly and watched the sweat gather on his dead hands, hesitate, drop off, plunge down toward sand and turn to steam half way there.\nNhoj fell.\nThe wire was cut. Nhoj fell flat upon his stomach, a gout of blood kicked from his mouth. His eyes rolled back into a white, senseless insanity.\nNhoj fell. So did his fifty duplicate illusions.\nAll across the valley the winds sang and moaned and Sim saw a blue lake with a blue river feeding it and low white houses near the river with people going and coming in the houses and among the tall green trees. Trees taller than seven men, beside the river mirage.\n\"Now,\" explained Sim to himself at last, \"Now I can fall. Right—into—that—lake.\"\nHe fell forward.\nHe was shocked when he felt the hands eagerly stop him in mid-plunge, lift him, hurry him off, high in the hungry air, like a torch held and waved, ablaze.\n\"How strange is death,\" he thought, and blackness took him.\n*****\nHe wakened to the flow of cool water on his cheeks.\nHe opened his eyes fearfully. Lyte held his head upon her lap, her fingers were moving food to his mouth. He was tremendously hungry and tired, but fear squeezed both of these things away. He struggled upward, seeing the strange cave contours overhead.\n\"What time is it?\" he demanded.\n\"The same day as the contest. Be quiet,\" she said.\n\"The same day!\"\nShe nodded amusedly. \"You've lost nothing of your life. This is Nhoj's cave. We are inside the black cliff. We will live three extra days. Satisfied? Lie down.\"\n\"Nhoj is dead?\" He fell back, panting, his heart slamming his ribs. He relaxed slowly. \"I won. Gods, I won,\" he breathed.\n\"Nhoj is dead. So were we, almost. They carried us in from outside only in time.\"\nHe ate ravenously. \"We have no time to waste. We must get strong. My leg—\" He looked at it, tested it. There was a swathe of long yellow grasses around it and the ache had died away. Even as he watched the terrific pulsings of his body went to work and cured away the impurities under the bandages. It has to be strong by sunset, he thought. It has to be.\nHe got up and limped around the cave like a captured animal. He felt Lyte's eyes upon him. He could not meet her gaze. Finally, helplessly, he turned.\nShe interrupted him. \"You want to go on to the ship?\" she asked, softly. \"Tonight? When the sun goes down?\"\nHe took a breath, exhaled it. \"Yes.\"\n\"You couldn't possibly wait until morning?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then I'll go with you.\"\n\"No!\"\n\"If I lag behind, let me. There's nothing here for me.\"\nThey stared at each other a long while. He shrugged wearily.\n\"All right,\" he said, at last. \"I couldn't stop you, I know that. We'll go together.\"\n*****\nIX They waited in the mouth of their new cave. The sun set. The stones cooled so that one could walk on them. It was almost time for the leaping out and the running toward the distant, glittering metal seed that lay on the far mountain.\nSoon would come the rains. And Sim thought back over all the times he had watched the rains thicken into creeks, into rivers that cut new beds each night. One night there would be a river running north, the next a river running north-east, the third night a river running due west. The valley was continually cut and scarred by the torrents. Earthquakes and avalanches filled the old beds. New ones were the order of the day. It was this idea of the river and the directions of the river that he had turned over in his head for many hours. It might possibly—Well, he would wait and see.\nHe noticed how living in this new cliff had slowed his pulse, slowed everything. A mineral result, protection against the solar radiations. Life was still swift, but not as swift as before.\n\"Now, Sim!\" cried Lyte, testing the valley air.\nThey ran. Between the hot death and the cold one. Together, away from the cliffs, out toward the distant, beckoning ship.\nNever had they run this way in their lives. The sound of their feet running was a hard, insistent clatter over vast oblongs of rock, down into ravines, up the sides, and on again. They raked the air in and out their lungs. Behind them the cliffs faded away into things they could never turn back to now.\nThey did not eat as they ran. They had eaten to the bursting point in the cave, to save time. Now it was only running, a lifting of legs, a balancing of bent elbows, a convulsion of muscles, a slaking in of air that had been fiery and was now cooling.\n\"Are they watching us?\"\nLyte's breathless voice snatched at his ears, above the pound of his heart.\nWho? But he knew the answer. The cliff peoples, of course. How long had it been since a race like this one? A thousand days? Ten thousand? How long since someone had taken the chance and sprinted with an entire civilization's eyes upon their backs, into gullies, across cooling plain. Were there lovers pausing in their laughter back there, gazing at the two tiny dots that were a man and woman running toward destiny? Were children eating of new fruits and stopping in their play to see the two people racing against time? Was Dienc still living, narrowing hairy eyebrows down over fading eyes, shouting them on in a feeble, rasping voice, shaking a twisted hand? Were there jeers? Were they being called fools, idiots? And in the midst of the name calling, were people praying them on, hoping they would reach the ship? Yes, under all the cynicism and pessimism, some of them, all of them, must be praying.\nSim took a quick glance at the sky, which was beginning to bruise with the coming night. Out of nowhere clouds materialized and a light shower trailed across a gully two hundred yards ahead of them. Lightning beat upon distant mountains and there was a strong scent of ozone on the disturbed air.\n\"The halfway mark,\" panted Sim, and he saw Lyte's face half turn, longingly looking back at the life she was leaving. \"Now's the time, if we want to turn back, we still have time. Another minute—\"\n*****\nThunder snarled in the mountains. An avalanche started out small and ended up huge and monstrous in a deep fissure. Light rain dotted Lyte's smooth white skin. In a minute her hair was glistening and soggy with rain.\n\"Too late now,\" she shouted over the patting rhythm of her own naked feet. \"We've got to go ahead!\"\nAnd it was too late. Sim knew, judging the distances, that there was no turning back now.\nHis leg began to pain him a little. He favored it, slowing. A wind came up swiftly. A cold wind that bit into the skin. But it came from the cliffs behind them, helped rather than hindered them. An omen? he wondered. No.\nFor as the minutes went by it grew upon him how poorly he had estimated the distance. Their time was dwindling out, but they were still an impossible distance from the ship. He said nothing, but the impotent anger at the slow muscles in his legs welled up into bitterly hot tears in his eyes.\nHe knew that Lyte was thinking the same as himself. But she flew along like a white bird, seeming hardly to touch ground. He heard her breath go out and in her throat, like a clean, sharp knife in its sheathe.\nHalf the sky was dark. The first stars were peering through lengths of black cloud. Lightning jiggled a path along a rim just ahead of them. A full thunderstorm of violent rain and exploding electricity fell upon them.\nThey slipped and skidded on moss-smooth pebbles. Lyte fell, scrambled up again with a burning oath. Her body was scarred and dirty. The rain washed over her.\nThe rain came down and cried on Sim. It filled his eyes and ran in rivers down his spine and he wanted to cry with it.\nLyte fell and did not rise, sucking her breath, her breasts quivering.\nHe picked her up and held her. \"Run, Lyte, please, run!\"\n\"Leave me, Sim. Go ahead!\" The rain filled her mouth. There was water everywhere. \"It's no use. Go on without me.\"\nHe stood there, cold and powerless, his thoughts sagging, the flame of hope blinking out. All the world was blackness, cold falling sheathes of water, and despair.\n\"We'll walk, then,\" he said. \"And keep walking, and resting.\"\nThey walked for fifty yards, easily, slowly, like children out for a stroll. The gully ahead of them filled with water that went sliding away with a swift wet sound, toward the horizon.\nSim cried out. Tugging at Lyte he raced forward. \"A new channel,\" he said, pointing. \"Each day the rain cuts a new channel. Here, Lyte!\" He leaned over the flood waters.\nHe dived in, taking her with him.\nThe flood swept them like bits of wood. They fought to stay upright, the water got into their mouths, their noses. The land swept by on both sides of them. Clutching Lyte's fingers with insane strength, Sim felt himself hurled end over end, saw flicks of lightning on high, and a new fierce hope was born in him. They could no longer run, well, then they would let the water do the running for them.\nWith a speed that dashed them against rocks, split open their shoulders, abraded their legs, the new, brief river carried them. \"This way!\" Sim shouted over a salvo of thunder and steered frantically toward the opposite side of the gully. The mountain where the ship lay was just ahead. They must not pass it by. They fought in the transporting liquid and were slammed against the far side. Sim leaped up, caught at an overhanging rock, locked Lyte in his legs, and drew himself hand over hand upward.\nAs quickly as it had come, the storm was gone. The lightning faded. The rain ceased. The clouds melted and fell away over the sky. The wind whispered into silence.\n\"The ship!\" Lyte lay upon the ground. \"The ship, Sim. This is the mountain of the ship!\"\nNow the cold came. The killing cold.\nThey forced themselves drunkenly up the mountain. The cold slid along their limbs, got into their arteries like a chemical and slowed them.\nAhead of them, with a fresh-washed sheen, lay the ship. It was a dream. Sim could not believe that they were actually so near it. Two hundred yards. One hundred and seventy yards. Gods, but it was cold.\nThe ground became covered with ice. They slipped and fell again and again. Behind them the river was frozen into a blue-white snake of cold solidity. A few last drops of rain from somewhere came down as hard pellets.\nSim fell against the bulk of the ship. He was actually touching it. Touching it! He heard Lyte whimpering in her constricted throat. This was the metal, the ship. How many others had touched it in the long days? He and Lyte had made it!\nHe touched it lovingly. Then, as cold as the air, his veins were chilled.\nWhere was the entrance?\nYou run, you swim, you almost drown, you curse, you sweat, you work, you reach a mountain, you go up it, you hammer on metal, you shout with relief, you reach the ship, and then—you can't find the entrance.\n*****\nHe fought to keep himself from breaking down. Slowly, he told himself, but not too slowly, go around the ship. The metal slid under his searching hands, so cold that his hands, sweating, almost froze to it. Now, far around to the side. Lyte moved with him. The cold held them like a fist. It began to squeeze.\nThe entrance.\nMetal. Cold, immutable metal. A thin line of opening at the sealing point. Throwing all caution aside, he beat at it. He felt his stomach seething with cold. His fingers were numb, his eyes were half frozen in their sockets. He began to beat and search and scream against the metal door. \"Open up! Open up!\" He staggered.\nThe air-lock sighed. With a whispering of metal on rubber beddings, the door swung softly sidewise and vanished back.\nHe saw Lyte run forward, clutch at her throat, and drop inside a small shiny chamber. He shuffled after her, blankly.\nThe air-lock door sealed shut behind him.\nHe could not breathe. His heart began to slow, to stop.\nThey were trapped inside the ship now, and something was happening. He sank down to his knees and choked for air.\nThe ship he had come to for salvation was now slowing his pulse, darkening his brain, poisoning him. With a starved, faint kind of expiring terror, he realized that he was dying.\nBlackness.\n*****\nHe had a dim sense of time passing, of thinking, struggling, to make his heart go quick, quick.... To make his eyes focus. But the fluid in his body lagged quietly through his settling veins and he heard his temple pulses thud, pause, thud, pause and thud again with lulling intermissions.\nHe could not move, not a hand or leg or finger. It was an effort to lift the tonnage of his eyelashes. He could not shift his face even, to see Lyte lying beside him.\nFrom a distance came her irregular breathing. It was like the sound a wounded bird makes with his dry, unraveled pinions. She was so close he could almost feel the heat of her; yet she seemed a long way removed.\nI'm getting cold! he thought. Is this death? This slowing of blood, of my heart, this cooling of my body, this drowsy thinking of thoughts?\nStaring at the ship's ceiling he traced its intricate system of tubes and machines. The knowledge, the purpose of the ship, its actions, seeped into him. He began to understand in a kind of revealing lassitude just what these things were his eyes rested upon. Slow. Slow.\nThere was an instrument with a gleaming white dial.\nIts purpose?\nHe drudged away at the problem, like a man underwater.\nPeople had used the dial. Touched it. People had repaired it. Installed it. People had dreamed of it before the building, before the installing, before the repairing and touching and using. The dial contained memory of use and manufacture, its very shape was a dream-memory telling Sim why and for what it had been built. Given time, looking at anything, he could draw from it the knowledge he desired. Some dim part of him reached out, dissected the contents of things, analyzed them.\nThis dial measured time!\nMillions of days of time!\nBut how could that be? Sim's eyes dilated, hot and glittering. Where were humans who needed such an instrument?\nBlood thrummed and beat behind his eyes. He closed them.\nPanic came to him. The day was passing. I am lying here, he thought, and my life slips away. I cannot move. My youth is passing. How long before I can move?\nThrough a kind of porthole he saw the night pass, the day come, the day pass, and again another night. Stars danced frostily.\nI will lie here for four or five days, wrinkling and withering, he thought. This ship will not let me move. How much better if I had stayed in my home cliff, lived, enjoyed this short life. What good has it done to come here? I'm missing all the twilights and dawns. I'll never touch Lyte, though she's here at my side.\nDelirium. His mind floated up. His thoughts whirled through the metal ship. He smelled the razor sharp smell of joined metal. He heard the hull contract with night, relax with day.\nDawn.\nAlready—another dawn!\nToday I would have been mature. His jaw clenched. I must get up. I must move. I must enjoy my time of maturity.\nBut he didn't move. He felt his blood pump sleepily from chamber to red chamber in his heart, on down and around through his dead body, to be purified by his folding and unfolding lungs. Then the circuit once more.\nThe ship grew warm. From somewhere a machine clicked. Automatically the temperature cooled. A controlled gust of air flushed the room.\nNight again. And then another day.\nHe lay and saw four days of his life pass.\nHe did not try to fight. It was no use. His life was over.\nHe didn't want to turn his head now. He didn't want to see Lyte with her face like his tortured mother's—eyelids like gray ash flakes, eyes like beaten, sanded metal, cheeks like eroded stones. He didn't want to see a throat like parched thongs of yellow grass, hands the pattern of smoke risen from a fire, breasts like desiccated rinds and hair stubbly and unshorn as moist gray weeds!\nAnd himself? How did he look? Was his jaw sunken, the flesh of his eyes pitted, his brow lined and age-scarred?\n*****\nHis strength began to return. He felt his heart beating so slow that it was amazing. One hundred beats a minute. Impossible. He felt so cool, so thoughtful, so easy.\nHis head fell over to one side. He stared at Lyte. He shouted in surprise.\nShe was young and fair.\nShe was looking at him, too weak to say anything. Her eyes were like tiny silver medals, her throat curved like the arm of a child. Her hair was blue fire eating at her scalp, fed by the slender life of her body.\nFour days had passed and still she was young ... no, younger than when they had entered the ship. She was still adolescent.\nHe could not believe it.\nHer first words were, \"How long will this last?\"\nHe replied, carefully. \"I don't know.\"\n\"We are still young.\"\n\"The ship. Its metal is around us. It cuts away the sun and the things that came from the sun to age us.\"\nHer eyes shifted thoughtfully. \"Then, if we stay here—\"\n\"We'll remain young.\"\n\"Six more days? Fourteen more? Twenty?\"\n\"More than that, maybe.\"\nShe lay there, silently. After a long time she said, \"Sim?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Let's stay here. Let's not go back. If we go back now, you know what'll happen to us...?\"\n\"I'm not certain.\"\n\"We'll start getting old again, won't we?\"\nHe looked away. He stared at the ceiling and the clock with the moving finger. \"Yes. We'll grow old.\"\n\"What if we grow old—instantly. When we step from the ship won't the shock be too much?\"\n\"Maybe.\"\nAnother silence. He began to move his limbs, testing them. He was very hungry. \"The others are waiting,\" he said.\nHer next words made him gasp. \"The others are dead,\" she said. \"Or will be in a few hours. All those we knew back there are old and worn.\"\nHe tried to picture them old. Dark, his sister, bent and senile with time. He shook his head, wiping the picture away. \"They may die,\" he said. \"But there are others who've been born.\"\n\"People we don't even know,\" said Lyte, flatly.\n\"But, nevertheless, our people,\" he replied. \"People who'll live only eight days, or eleven days unless we help them.\"\n\"But we're young, Sim! We're young! We can stay young!\"\nHe didn't want to listen. It was too tempting a thing to listen to. To stay here. To live. \"We've already had more time than the others,\" he said. \"I need workers. Men to heal this ship. We'll get on our feet now, you and I, and find food, eat, and see if the ship is movable. I'm afraid to try to move it myself. It's so big. I'll need help.\"\n\"But that means running back all that distance!\"\n\"I know.\" He lifted himself weakly. \"But I'll do it.\"\n\"How will you get the men back here?\"\n\"We'll use the river.\"\n\"If it's there. It may be somewhere else.\"\n\"We'll wait until there is one, then. I've got to go back, Lyte. The son of Dienc is waiting for me, my sister, your brother, are old people, ready to die, and waiting for some word from us—\"\nAfter a long while he heard her move, dragging herself tiredly to him. She put her head upon his chest, her eyes closed, stroking his arm. \"I'm sorry. Forgive me. You have to go back. I'm a selfish fool.\"\nHe touched her cheek, clumsily. \"You're human. I understand you. There's nothing to forgive.\"\n*****\nThey found food. They walked through the ship. It was empty. Only in the control room did they find the remains of a man who must have been the chief pilot. The others had evidently bailed out into space in emergency lifeboats. This pilot, sitting at his controls, alone, had landed the ship on a mountain within sight of other fallen and smashed crafts. Its location on high ground had saved it from the floods. The pilot himself had died, probably of heart failure, soon after landing. The ship had remained here, almost within reach of the other survivors, perfect as an egg, but silent, for—how many thousand days? If the pilot had lived, what a different thing life might have been for the ancestors of Sim and Lyte. Sim, thinking of this—felt the distant, ominous vibration of war. How had the war between worlds come out? Who had won? Or had both planets lost and never bothered trying to pick up survivors? Who had been right? Who was the enemy? Were Sim's people of the guilty or innocent side? They might never know.\nHe checked the ship hurriedly. He knew nothing of its workings, yet as he walked its corridors, patted its machines, he learned from it. It needed only a crew. One man couldn't possibly set the whole thing running again. He laid his hand upon one round, snout-like machine. He jerked his hand away, as if burnt.\n\"Lyte!\"\n\"What is it?\"\nHe touched the machine again, caressed it, his hand trembled violently, his eyes welled with tears, his mouth opened and closed, he looked at the machine, loving it, then looked at Lyte.\n\"With this machine—\" he stammered, softly, incredulously. \"With—with this machine I can—\"\n\"What, Sim?\"\nHe inserted his hand into a cup-like contraption with a lever inside. Out of porthole in front of him he could see the distant line of cliffs. \"We were afraid there might never be another river running by this mountain, weren't we?\" he asked, exultantly.\n\"Yes, Sim, but—\"\n\"There will be a river. And I will come back, tonight! And I'll bring men with me. Five hundred men! Because with this machine I can blast a river bottom all the way to the cliffs, down which the waters will rush, giving myself and the men a swift, sure way of traveling back!\" He rubbed the machine's barrel-like body. \"When I touched it, the life and method of it shot into me! Watch!\" He depressed the lever.\nA beam of incandescent fire lanced out from the ship, screaming.\nSteadily, accurately, Sim began to cut away a river bed for the storm waters to flow in. The night was turned to day by its hungry eating.\n*****\nThe return to the cliffs was to be carried out by Sim alone. Lyte was to remain in the ship, in case of any mishap. The trip back seemed, at first glance, to be impossible. There would be no river rushing to cut his time, to sweep him along toward his destination. He would have to run the entire distance in the dawn, and the sun would get him, catch him before he'd reached safety.\n\"The only way to do it is to start before sunrise.\"\n\"But you'd be frozen, Sim.\"\n\"Here.\" He made adjustments on the machine that had just finished cutting the river bed in the rock floor of the valley. He lifted the smooth snout of the gun, pressed the lever, left it down. A gout of fire shot toward the cliffs. He fingered the range control, focused the flame end three miles from its source. Done. He turned to Lyte. \"But I don't understand,\" she said.\nHe opened the air-lock door. \"It's bitter cold out, and half an hour yet till dawn. If I run parallel to the flame from the machine, close enough to it, there'll not be much heat but enough to sustain life, anyway.\"\n\"It doesn't sound safe,\" Lyte protested.\n\"Nothing does, on this world.\" He moved forward. \"I'll have a half hour start. That should be enough to reach the cliffs.\"\n\"But if the machine should fail while you're still running near its beam?\"\n\"Let's not think of that,\" he said.\nA moment later he was outside. He staggered as if kicked in the stomach. His heart almost exploded in him. The environment of his world forced him into swift living again. He felt his pulse rise, kicking through his veins.\nThe night was cold as death. The heat ray from the ship sliced across the valley, humming, solid and warm. He moved next to it, very close. One misstep in his running and—\n\"I'll be back,\" he called to Lyte.\nHe and the ray of light went together.\n*****\nIn the early morning the peoples in the caves saw the long finger of orange incandescence and the weird whitish apparition floating, running along beside it. There was muttering and superstition.\nSo when Sim finally reached the cliffs of his childhood he saw alien peoples swarming there. There were no familiar faces. Then he realized how foolish it was to expect familiar faces. One of the older men glared down at him. \"Who're you?\" he shouted. \"Are you from the enemy cliff? What's your name?\"\n\"I am Sim, the son of Sim!\"\n\"Sim!\"\nAn old woman shrieked from the cliff above him. She came hobbling down the stone pathway. \"Sim, Sim, it is you!\"\nHe looked at her, frankly bewildered. \"But I don't know you,\" he murmured.\n\"Sim, don't you recognize me? Oh, Sim, it's me! Dark!\"\n\"Dark!\"\nHe felt sick at his stomach. She fell into his arms. This old, trembling woman with the half-blind eyes, his sister.\nAnother face appeared above. That of an old man. A cruel, bitter face. It looked down at Sim and snarled. \"Drive him away!\" cried the old man. \"He comes from the cliff of the enemy. He's lived there! He's still young! Those who go there can never come back among us. Disloyal beast!\" And a rock hurtled down.\nSim leaped aside, pulling the old woman with him.\nA roar came from the people. They ran toward Sim, shaking their fists. \"Kill him, kill him!\" raved the old man, and Sim did not know who he was.\n\"Stop!\" Sim held out his hands. \"I come from the ship!\"\n\"The ship?\" The people slowed. Dark clung to him, looking up into his young face, puzzling over its smoothness.\n\"Kill him, kill him, kill him!\" croaked the old man, and picked up another rock.\n\"I offer you ten days, twenty days, thirty more days of life!\"\nThe people stopped. Their mouths hung open. Their eyes were incredulous.\n\"Thirty days?\" It was repeated again and again. \"How?\"\n\"Come back to the ship with me. Inside it, one can live forever!\"\nThe old man lifted high a rock, then, choking, fell forward in an apoplectic fit, and tumbled down the rocks to lie at Sim's feet.\nSim bent to peer at the ancient one, at the bleary, dead eyes, the loose, sneering lips, the crumpled, quiet body.\n\"Chion!\"\n\"Yes,\" said Dark behind him, in a croaking, strange voice. \"Your enemy. Chion.\"\n*****\nThat night a thousand warriors started for the ship as if going to war. The water ran in the new channel. Five hundred of them were drowned or lost behind in the cold. The others, with Sim, got through to the ship.\nLyte awaited them, and threw wide the metal door.\nThe weeks passed. Generations lived and died in the cliffs, while the five hundred workers labored over the ship, learning its functions and its parts.\nOn the last day they disbanded. Each ran to his station. Now there was a destiny of travel who still remained behind.\nSim touched the control plates under his fingers.\nLyte, rubbing her eyes, came and sat on the floor next to him, resting her head against his knee, drowsily. \"I had a dream,\" she said, looking off at something far away. \"I dreamed I lived in caves in a cliff on a cold-hot planet where people grew old and died in eight days and were burnt.\"\n\"What an impossible dream,\" said Sim. \"People couldn't possibly live in such a nightmare. Forget it. You're awake now.\"\nHe touched the plates gently. The ship rose and moved into space. Sim was right. The nightmare was over at last.\nFrom https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/63874/pg63874-images.html "},{"id":24,"href":"/site/library/weir-the-egg/","title":"The Egg","section":"Library","content":"You were on your way home when you died.\nIt was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.\nAnd that’s when you met me.\n“What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”\n“You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.\n“There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”\n“Yup,” I said.\n“I… I died?”\n“Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,” I said.\nYou looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”\n“More or less,” I said.\n“Are you god?” You asked.\n“Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”\n“My kids… my wife,” you said.\n“What about them?”\n“Will they be all right?”\n“That’s what I like to see,” I said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good stuff right there.”\nYou looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.\n“Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”\n“Oh,” you said. “So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”\n“Neither,” I said. “You’ll be reincarnated.”\n“Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus were right,”\n“All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”\nYou followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”\n“Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”\n“So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”\n“Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”\nI stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.\n“You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”\n“How many times have I been reincarnated, then?”\n“Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.”\n“Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?”\n“Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.”\n“Where you come from?” You said.\n“Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”\n“Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.”\n“Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”\n“So what’s the point of it all?”\n“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”\n“Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.\nI looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”\n“You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”\n“No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”\n“Just me? What about everyone else?”\n“There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.”\nYou stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”\n“All you. Different incarnations of you.”\n“Wait. I’m everyone!?”\n“Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.\n“I’m every human being who ever lived?”\n“Or who will ever live, yes.”\n“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”\n“And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added.\n“I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.\n“And you’re the millions he killed.”\n“I’m Jesus?”\n“And you’re everyone who followed him.”\nYou fell silent.\n“Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself.

Bald and fat and old. But he didn't say it aloud. Instead, he pushed back his chair, got to his feet, and came resolutely around the side of his desk, his right hand rigidly extended. Smiling with forced amiability, he shook hands with the young man. “Witwer?” he asked, managing to make this query sound gracious. “That's right,” the young man said. “But my name's Ed to you, of course. That is, if you share my dislike for needless formality.” The look on his blond, overly-confident face showed that he considered the matter settled. It would be Ed and John: Everything would be agreeably cooperative right from the start. “Did you have much trouble finding the building?” Anderton asked guardedly, ignoring the too-friendly overture. Good god, he had to hold on to something. Fear touched him as he began to sweat. Witwer was moving around the office as if he already owned it — as if he were measuring it for size. Couldn't he wait a couple of days — a decent interval? “No trouble,” Witwer answered blithely, his hands in his pockets. Eagerly, he examined the voluminous files that lined the wall. “I'm not coming into your agency blind, you understand. I have quite a few ideas of my own about the way Precrime is run.” Shakily, Anderton lit his pipe. “How is it run? I should like to know.” “Not badly,” Witwer said. “If fact, quite well.” Anderton regarded him steadily. “Is that your private opinion? Or is it just cant?” Witwer met his gaze guilelessly. “Private and public. The Senate's pleased with your work. In fact, they're enthusiastic.” He added, “As enthusiastic as very old men can be.” Anderton winced, but outwardly he remained impassive. It cost him an effort, though. We wondered what Witwer really thought. What was actually going on in that closecropped skull? The young man's eyes were blue, bright — and disturbingly clever. Witwer was nobody's fool. And obviously he had a great deal of ambition. “As I understand it,” Anderton said cautiously, “you're going to be my assistant until I retire.” “That's my understanding, too,” the other replied, without an instant's hesitation. “Which may be this year, or next year — or ten years from now.” The pipe in Anderton's hand trembled. “I'm under no compulsion to retire. I founded Precrime and I can stay on here as long as I want. It's purely my decision.” Witwer nodded, his expression still guileless. “Of course.” With an effort, Anderton cooled down a trifle. “I merely wanted to get things straight.” “From the start,” Witwer agreed. “You're the boss. What you say goes.” With every evidence of sincerity, he asked: “Would you care to show me the organisation? I'd like to familiarize myself with the general routine as soon as possible.” As they walked along the busy, yellow-lit tiers of offices, Anderton said: “You're acquainted with the theory of precrime, of course. I presume we can take that for granted.” “I have the information publicly available,” Witwer replied. “With the aid of your precog mutants, you've boldly and successfully abolished the post-crime punitive system of jails and fines. As we all realise, punishment was never much of a deterrent, and could scarcely have afforded the comfort to a victim already dead.” They had come to the descent lift. As it carried them swiftly downward, Anderton said: “You've probably already grasped the basic legalistic drawback to precrime methodology. We're taking in individuals who have broken no law.” “But surely, they will,” Witwer affirmed with conviction. “Happily, they don't — because we get to them first, before they can commit an act of violence. So the commission of the crime itself is absolute metaphysics. We can claim they are culpable. They, on the other hand, can eternally claim they're innocent. And, in a sense, they are innocent.” The lift let them out, and they again paced down a yellow corridor. “In our society, we have no major crimes,” Anderton went on, “but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals.” Doors opened and closed, and they were in the analytical wing. Ahead of them rose impressive banks of equipment — the data-receptors, and the computing mechanisms that studied and restructured the incoming material. And beyond the machinery sat the three precogs, almost lost to view in the maze of wiring. “There they are,” Anderton said dryly. “What do you think of them?” In the gloomy half-darkness the three idiots sat babbling. Every incoherent utterance, every random syllable, was analysed, compared, reassembled in the form of visual symbols, transcribed on conventional punchcards, and ejected into various coded slots. All day long the idiots babbled, imprisoned in their special high-backed chairs, held in one rigid position by metal bands, and bundles of wiring, clamps. Their physical needs were taken care of automatically. They had no spiritual needs. Vegetable-like, they muttered and dozed and existed. Their minds were dull, confused, lost in shadows. But not shadows of today. The three gibbering, fumbling creatures with their enlarged head and wasted bodies, were contemplating the future. The analytical machinery was recording prophecies, and as the three precog idiots talked, the machinery carefully listened. For the first time, Witwer's face lost its breezy confidence. A sick, dismayed expression crept into his eyes, a mixture of shame and moral shock. “It's not — pleasant,” he murmured. “I didn't realize they were so — ” He groped in his mind for the right word, gesticulating. “So — deformed.” “Deformed and retarded,” Anderton instantly agreed. “Especially the girl, there. Donna is forty-five years old. But she looks about ten. The talent absorbs everything; the esp-lobe shrivels the balance of the frontal area. But what do we care? We get their prophecies. They pass on what we need. They don't understand any of it, but we do.” Subdued, Witwer crossed the room to the machinery. From a slot he collected a stack of cards. “Are these names that have come up?” he asked. “Obviously.” Frowning, Anderton took the stack from him. “I haven't had a chance to examine them,” he explained, impatiently concealing his annoyance. Fascinated, Witwer watched the machinery pop a fresh card into the now empty slot. It was followed by a second — and a third. From the whirring disks came one card after another. “The precogs must see quite far into the future,” Witwer exclaimed. “They see a quite limited span,” Anderton informed him. “One week or two ahead at the very most. Much of their data is worthless to us — simply not relevant to our line. We pass it on to the appropriate agencies. And they in turn trade data with us. Every important bureau has its cellar of treasured monkeys.” “Monkeys?” Witwer stared at him uneasily. “Oh, yes, I understand. See no evil, speak no evil, et cetera. Very amusing.” “Very apt.” Automatically, Anderton collected the fresh cards which had been turned up by the spinning machinery. “Some of these name will be totally discarded. And most of the remainder record petty crimes: thefts, income tax evasion, assault, extortion. As I'm sure you know, Precrime has cut down felonies by ninety- nine and decimal point eight percent. We seldom get actual murder or treason. After all, the culprit knows we'll confined him in the detention camp a week before he gets a chance to commit the crime.” “When was the last time an actual murder was committed?” Witwer asked. “Fiver years ago,” Anderton said, pride in his voice. “How did it happen?” “The criminal escaped our teams. We had his name — in fact, we had all the details of the crime, including the victim's name. We knew the exact moment, the location of the planned act of violence. But in spite of us he was able to carry it out.” Anderton shrugged. “After all, we can't get all of them.” He riffled the cards. “But we do get most.” “One murder in five years.” Witwer's confidence was returning. “Quite an impressive record…something to be proud of.” Quietly Anderton said: “I am proud. Thirty years ago I worked out the theory — back in the days when self-seekers were thinking in terms of quick raids on the stock market. I saw something legitimate ahead — something of tremendous social value.” He tossed the packet of cards to Wally Page, his subordinate in charge of the monkey block. “See which ones we want,” he told him. “Use your own judgment.” As Page disappeared with the cards, Witwer said thoughtfully: “It's a big responsibility.” “Yes, it is,” agreed Anderton. “If we let one criminal escape — as we did five years ago — we've got a human life on our conscience. We're solely responsible. If we slip up, somebody dies.” Bitterly, he jerked three new cards from the slot. “It's a public trust.” “Are you ever tempted to — ” Witwer hesitated. “I mean, some of the men you pick up must offer you plenty.” “It wouldn't do any good. A duplicate file of cards pops out at the Army GHQ. It's check and balance. They can keep their eye on us as continuously as they wish.” Anderton glanced briefly at the top card. “So even if we wanted to accept a — ” He broke off, his lips tightening. “What's the matter?” Witwer asked curiously. Carefully, Anderton folded the top card and put it away in his pocket. “Nothing,” he muttered. “Nothing at all.” The harshness in his voice brought a flush to Witwer's face. “You really don't like me,” he observed. “True,” Anderton admitted. “I don't. But — ” He couldn't believe he disliked the young man that much. It didn't seem possible: it wasn't possible. Something was wrong. Dazed, he tried to steady his tumbling mind. On the card was his name. Line one — an already accused future murderer! According to the code punches, Precrime Commissioner John A. Anderton was going to kill a man — within the next week. With absolute, overwhelming conviction, he didn't believe it. II In the outer office, talking to Page, stood Anderton's slim and attractive young wife, Lisa. She was engaged in a sharp, animated discussion of policy, and barely glanced up as Witwer and her husband entered. “Hello, darling,” Anderton said. Witwer remained silent. But his pale eyes flickered slightly as they rested on the brown-haired woman in her trim police uniform. Lisa was now an executive officer of Precrime but once, Witwer knew, she had been Anderton's secretary. Noticing the interest on Witwer's face, Anderton paused and reflected. To plant the card in the machines would require an accomplice on the inside — someone who was closely connected with Precrime and had access to the analytical equipment. Lisa was an improbable element. But the possibility did exist. Of course, the conspiracy could be large-scale and elaborate, involving far more than a “rigged” card inserted somewhere along the line. The original data itself might have been tampered with. Actually, there was no telling how far back the alteration went. A cold fear touched him as he began to see the possibilities. His original impulse — to tear open the machines and remove the data — was uselessly primitive. Probably the tapes agreed with the card: He would only incriminate himself further. He had approximately twenty-four hours. Then, the Army people would check over their cards and discover the discrepancy. They would find in their files a duplicate of the card he had appropriated. He hand only one of two copies, which meant that the folded card in his pocket might just as well be lying on Page's desk in plain view of everyone. From outside the building came the drone of police cars starting out on their routine round-ups. How many hours would elapse before one of them pulled up in front of his house? “What's the matter, darling?” Lisa asked him uneasily. “You look as if you've just seen a ghost. Are you all right?” “I'm fine,” he assured her. Lisa suddenly seemed to become aware of Ed Witwer's admiring scrutiny. “Is this gentleman your new co- worker, darling?” she asked. Warily, Anderton introduced his new associate. Lisa smiled in friendly greeting. Did a covert awareness pass between them? He couldn't tell. God, he was beginning to suspect everybody — not only his wife and Witwer, but a dozen members of his staff. “Are you from New York?” Lisa asked. “No,” Witwer replied. “I've lived most of my life in Chicago. I'm staying at a hotel — one of the big hotels downtown. Wait — I have the name written on a card somewhere.” While he self-consciously searched his pockets, Lisa suggested: “Perhaps you'd like to have dinner with us. We'll be working in close cooperation, and I really think we ought to get better acquainted.” Startled, Anderton began backing off. What were the chances of his wife's friendliness being benign, accidental? Witwer would present the balance of the evening, and would now have and excuse to trail along to Anderton's private residence. Profoundly disturbed, he turned impulsively, and moved toward the door. “Where are you going?” Lisa asked, astonished. “Back to the monkey block,” he told her. “I want to check over some rather puzzling data tapes before the Army sees them.” He was out in the corridor before she could think of a reason for detaining him. Rapidly, he made his way to the ramp at its far end. He was striding down the outside stairs toward the public sidewalk, when Lisa appeared breathlessly behind him. “What on earth has come over you?” Catching hold of his arm, she moved quickly in front of him. “I knew you were leaving,” she exclaimed, blocking his way. “What's wrong with you? Everybody things you're — ” She checked herself. “I mean, you're acting erratically.” People surged by them — the usual afternoon crowd. Ignoring them, Anderton pried his wife's fingers from his arm. “I'm getting out,” he told her. “While there's still time.” “But — why?” “I'm being framed — deliberately and maliciously. This creature is out to get my job. The Senate is getting at me through him.” Lisa gazed up at him, bewildered. “But he seems like such a nice young man.” “Nice as a water moccasin.” Lisa's dismay turned to disbelief. “I don't believe it. Darling, all this strain you've been under — ” Smiling uncertainly, she faltered: “It's not really credible that Ed Witwer is trying to frame you. How could he, even if he wanted to? Surely Ed wouldn't — ” “Ed?” “That's his name, isn't it?” Her brown eyes flashed in startled, wildly incredulous protest. “Good heavens, you're suspicious of everybody. You actually believe I'm mixed up with it in some way, don't you?” He considered. “I'm not sure.” She drew closer to him, her eyes accusing. “That's not true. You really believe it. Maybe you ought to go away for a few weeks. You desperately need a rest. All this tension and trauma, a young man coming in. You're acting paranoiac. Can't you see that? People plotting against you. Tell me, do you have any actual proof?” Anderton removed his wallet and took out the folded card. “Examine this carefully,” he said, handing it to her. The colour drained out of her face, and she gave a little harsh, dry gasp. “The set-up is fairly obvious,” Anderton told her, as levelly as he could. “This will give Witwer the legal pretext to remove me right now. He won't have to wait until I resign.” Grimly, he added, “They know I'm good for a few years yet.” “But — ” “It will end the check and balance system. Precrime will no longer be an independent agency. The Senate will control the police, and after that — ” His lips tightened. “They'll absorb the Army too. Well, it's outwardly logical enough. Of course I fell hostility and resentment toward Witwer — of course I have a motive.” “Nobody likes to be replaced by a younger man, and find himself turned out to pasture. It's all really quite plausible — except that I haven't the remotest intention of killing Witwer. But I can't prove that. So what can I do?” Mutely, her face very white, Lisa shook her head. “I — I don't know. Darling, if only — ” “Right now,” Anderton said abruptly, “I'm going home to pack my things. That's about as far ahead as I can plan.” “You're really going to — to try to hide out?” “I am. As far as the Centaurian-colony planets, if necessary. It's been done successfully before, and I have a twenty-four hour head start.” He turned resolutely. “Go back inside. There's no point in your coming with me.” “Did you imagine I would?” Lisa asked huskily. Startled, Anderton stared at her. “Wouldn't you?” Then with amazement, he murmured: “No, I can see you don't believe me. You still think I'm imagining all this.” He jabbed savagely at the card. “Even with that evidence you still aren't convinced.” “No,” Lisa agreed quickly, “I'm not. You didn't look at it closely enough, darling. Ed Witwer's name isn't on it.” Incredulous, Anderton took the card from her. “Nobody says you're going to kill Ed Witwer,” Lisa continued rapidly, in a thin, brittle voice. “The card must be genuine, understand? And it has nothing to do with Ed. He's not plotting against you and neither is anybody else.” Too confused to reply, Anderton stood studying the card. She was right. Ed Witwer was not listed as his victim. On live five, the machine had neatly stamped another name. LEOPOLD KAPLAN Numbly, he pocketed the card. He had never head of the man in his life. III The house was cool and deserted, and almost immediately Anderton began making preparations for his journey. While he packed, frantic thoughts passed through his mind. Possibly he was wrong about Witwer — but how could he be sure? In any event, the conspiracy against him was far more complex than he had realized. Witwer, in the over-all picture, might be merely an insignificant puppet animated by someone else — by some distant, indistinct figure only vaguely visible in the background. It had been a mistake to show Lisa the card. Undoubtedly, she would describe it in detail to Witwer. He'd never get off Earth, never have an opportunity to find out was life on a frontier planet might be like. While he was thus preoccupied, a board creaked behind him. He turned from the bed, clutching a weather- stained winter sports jacket, to face the muzzle of a blue-grey A-pistol. “It didn't take you long,” he said, staring with bitterness at the tight-lipped heavyset main in a brown overcoat who stood holding the gun in his gloved hand. “Didn't she even hesitate?” The intruder's face registered no response. “I don't know what you're talking about,” he said. “Come along with me.” Startled, Anderton laid down the sports jacket. “You're not from my agency? You're not a police officer?” Protesting and astonished, he was hustled outside the house to a waiting limousine. Instantly three heavily armed men closed in behind him. The door slammed and the car shot off down the highway, away from the city. Impassive and remote, the faces around him jogged with the motion of the speeding vehicle as open fields, dark and sombre, sped past. Anderton was still trying futilely to grasp the implications of what had happened, when the car came to a rutted side road, turned off, and descended into a gloomy sub-surface garage. Someone shouted and order. The heavy metal lock grated shut and the overhead lights blinked on. The driver turned off the car motor. “You'll have reason to regret this,” Anderton warned hoarsely, as they dragged him from the car. “Do you realise who I am?” “We realise,” the main in the brown overcoat said. At gun-point, Anderton was marched upstairs, from the clammy silence of the garage into a deep-carpeted hallway. He was, apparently, in a luxurious private residence, set out in the war-devoured rural area. At the far end of the hallway he could make out a room — a book-lined study simply but tastefully furnished. In a circle of lamplight, his face partly in shadows, a man he had never met sat waiting for him. As Anderton approached, the man nervously slipped a pair of rimless glass in place, snapped the case shut, and moistened his dry lips. He was elderly, perhaps seventy or older, and under his arm was a slim silver can. His body was thin, wiry, his attitude curiously rigid. What little hair he was dusty brown — a carefully- smoothed sheen of neutral colour above his pale, bony skull. Only his eyes seemed alert. “Is this Anderton?” he inquired querulously, turning to the man in the brown overcoat. “Where did you pick him up?” “At his home,” the other replied. “He was packing — as we expected.” The man at the desk shivered visibly. “Packing.” He took off his glasses and jerkily returned them to their case. “Look here,” he said bluntly to Anderton, “what's the matter with you? Are you hopelessly insane? How could you kill a man you've never met?” The old man, Anderton suddenly realised, was Leopold Kaplan. “First, I'll ask you a question,” Anderton countered rapidly. “Do you realise what you've done? I'm Commissioner of Police. I can have you sent up for twenty years.” He was going to say more, but a sudden wonder cut him short. “ How did you find out?” he demanded. Involuntarily, his hand went to his pocket, where the folded card was hidden. “It won't be for another — ” “I wasn't notified through your agency,” Kaplan broke in, with angry impatience. “The fact that you've never heard of me doesn't surprise me too much. Leopold Kaplan, General of the Army of the Federated Westbloc Alliance.” Begrudgingly, he added. “Retired, since the end of the Anglo-Chinese War, and the abolishment of AFWA.” It made sense. Anderton had suspected that the Army processed its duplicates immediately for its own protection. Relaxing somewhat, he demanded: “Well? You've got me here. What's next?” “Evidently,” Kaplan said, “I'm not going to have you destroyed, or it would have shown up on one of those miserable little cards. I'm curious about you. It seemed incredible to me that a man of your stature could contemplate the cold-blooded murder of a total stranger. There must be something more here. Frankly, I'm puzzled. If it represented some kind of Police strategy — ” He shrugged his thin shoulders. “Surely you wouldn't have permitted the duplicate to reach us.” “Unless,” one of his men suggested, “it's a deliberate plant.” Kaplan raised his bright, bird-like eyes and scrutinized Anderton. “What do you have to say?” “That's exactly what it is,” Anderton said, quick to see that the advantage of stating frankly what he believed to be simple truth. “The prediction on the card was deliberately fabricated by a clique inside the police agency. The cared is prepared and I'm netted. I'm relieved of my authority automatically. My assistant steps in and claims he prevented the murder in the usual efficient Precrime manner. Needless to say, there is no murder or intent of murder.” “I agree with you that there will be no murder,” Kaplan affirmed grimly. “You'll be in police custody. I intend to make certain of that.” Horrified, Anderton protested: “You're taking me back there? If I'm in custody, I'll never be able to prove — ” “I don't care what you prove or don't prove,” Kaplan interrupted. “All I'm interested in is having you out of the way.” Frigidly, he added: “For my own protection.” “He was getting ready to leave,” one of the men asserted. “That's right,” Anderton said, sweating. “As soon as they get hold of me, I'll be confined in the detention camp. Witwer will take over — lock, stock, and barrel.” His face darkened. “And my wife. They're acting in concert, apparently.” For a moment, Kaplan seemed to waver. “It's possible,” he conceded, regarding Anderton steadily. Then he shook his head. “I can't take the chance. If this is a frame against you, I'm sorry. But it's simply not my affair.” He smiled slightly. “However, I wish you luck.” To the men, he said: “Take him to the police building and turn him over to the highest authority.” He mentioned the name of the acting commissioner, and waited for Anderton's reaction. “Witwer!” Anderton echoed, incredulous. Still smiling slightly, Kaplan turned and clicked on the console radio in the study. “Witwer has already assumed authority. Obviously, he's going to create quite an affair about this.” There was a brief static hum, and then, abruptly, the radio blared out into the room — a noisy professional voice, reading a prepared announcement. “…all citizens are warned not to shelter or in any fashion aid or assist this dangerous marginal individual. The extraordinary circumstance of an escaped criminal at liberty and in a position to commit an act of violence is unique in modern times. All citizens are hereby notified that legal statutes still in force implicate any and all persons failing to cooperate fully with the police in their task of apprehending John Allison Anderton. To repeat: The Precrime Agency of the Federal Westbloc Government is in the process of locating and neutralizing its former Commissioner, John Allison Anderton, who, through the methodology of the precrime-system, is hereby declared a potential murderer and as such forfeits his rights to freedom and all its privileges.” “It didn't take him long,” Anderton mutter, appalled. Kaplan snapped off the radio and the voice vanished. “Lisa must've gone directly to him,” Anderton speculated bitterly. “Why should we wait?” Kaplan asked. “You've made your intentions clear.” He nodded to his men. “Take him back to town. I feel uneasy having him so close. In that respect, I concur with Commissioner Witwer. I want him neutralized as soon as possible.” IV Cold, light rain beat against the pavement, as the car moved through the dark streets of New York City toward the police building. “You can see the point,” one of the men said to Anderton. “If you were in his place, you'd act just as decisively.” Sullen and resentful, Anderton stared straight ahead. “Anyhow,” the man went on, “you're just one of many. Thousands of people have gone to that detention camp. You won't be lonely. As a matter of fact, you may not want to leave.” Helplessly, Anderton watched the pedestrians hurrying along the rain-swept sidewalks. He felt no strong emotion. He was aware only of an overpowering fatigue. Dully, he checked off the street numbers: they were getting near the police station. “This Witwer seems to know how to take advantage of an opportunity,” one of the men observed conversationally. “Did you ever meet him?” “Briefly,” Anderton answered. “He wanted your job — so he framed you. Are you sure of that?” Anderton grimaced. “Does it matter?” “I was just curious.” The man eyed him languidly. “So you're the ex-Commissioner of Police. People in the camp will be glad to see you coming. They'll remember you.” “No doubt,” Anderton agreed. “Witwer sure didn't waste any time. Kaplan's lucky — with an official like that in charge.” The man looked at Anderton almost pleadingly. “You're really convinced it's a plot, eh?” “Of course.” “You wouldn't harm a hair on Kaplan's head. For the first time in history, Precrime goes wrong? An innocent main is framed by one of those cards. Maybe there've been other innocent people — right?” “It's quite possible,” Anderton admitted listlessly. “Maybe the whole system can break down. Sure, you're not going to commit a murder — and maybe none of them were. Is that why you told Kaplan you wanted to keep yourself outside? Were you hoping to prove the system wrong? I've got an open mind, if you want to talk about it.” Another man leaned over, and asked, “Just between the two of us, is there really anything to this plot stuff? Are you really being framed?” Anderton sighed. At that point he wasn't certain, himself. Perhaps he was trapped in a closed, meaningless time-circle with no motive and no beginning. In fact, he was almost ready to concede that he was the victim of a weary, neurotic fantasy, spawned by growing insecurity. Without a fight, he was willing to give himself up. A vast weight of possible exhaustion lay upon him. He was struggling against the impossible — and all the cards were stacked against him. The sharp squeal of tires roused him. Frantically, the driver struggled to control the car, tugging at the wheel and slamming on the brakes, as a massive bread truck loomed up from the fog and ran directly across the lane ahead. Had he gunned the motor instead he might have saved himself for a brief instant, and then smashed head on into the bread truck. Under Anderton the seat lifted up and flung him face-forward against the door. Paid, sudden, intolerable, seem to burst in his brain as he lay gasping and trying feebly to pull himself to his knees. Somewhere the crackle of fire echoed dismally, a patch of hissing brilliance winking in the swirls of mist making their way into the twisted bulk of the car. Hands from outside the car reached for him. Slowly he became aware that he was being dragged through the rent that had been the door. A heavy seat cushion was shoved brusquely aside, and all at once he found himself on his feet, leaning heavily against a dark shape and being guided into the shadows of an alley a short distance from the car. In the distance, police sirens wailed. “You'll live,” a voice grated in his ear, low and urgent. It was a voice he had never heard before, as unfamiliar and harsh as the rain beating into his face. “Can you hear what I'm saying?” “Yes,” Anderton acknowledged. He plucked aimlessly at the ripped sleeve of his shirt. A cut on his cheek was beginning to throb. Confused, he tried to orient himself. “You're not — ” “Stop talking and listen.” The man was heavyset, almost fat. Now his big hands held Anderton propped against the wet brick wall of the building, out of the rain and the flickering light of the burning car. “We had to do it that way,” he said. “It was the only alternative. We didn't have much time. We though Kaplan would keep you at his place longer.” “Who are you?” Anderton managed. The moist, rain-streaked face twisted into a humourless grin. “My name's Fleming. You'll see me again. We have about five seconds before the police get here. Then we're back where we started.” A flat packet was stuffed into Anderton's hands. “That's enough loot to keep you going. And there's a full set of identification there. We'll contact you from time to time.” His grin increased and became a nervous chuckle. “Until you've proved your point.” Anderton blinked. “It's a frameup, then?” “Of course.” Sharply, the man swore. “You mean they got you to believe it, too?” “I thought — ” Anderton had trouble talking; one of his front teeth seemed to be loose. “Hostility toward Witwer…replace, my wife and a younger man, natural resentment….” “Don't kid yourself,” the other said. “You know better than that. This whole business was worked out carefully. They had every phase of it under control. The card was set to pop the day Witwer appeared. They've already got the first part wrapped up. Witwer is Commissioner, and you're a hunted criminal.” “Who's behind it?” “Your wife.” Anderton's head spun. “You're positive?” The man laughed. “You bet your life.” He glanced quickly around. “Here come the police. Take off down this alley. Grab a bus, get yourself into the slum section, rent a room and buy a stack of magazines to keep you busy. Get other clothes — You're smart enough to take care of yourself. Don't try to leave Earth. They've got all the intersystem transports screened. If you can keep low for the next seven days, you've got it made.” “Who are you?” Anderton demanded. Fleming let go of him. Cautiously, he moved to the entrance of the alley and peered out. The first police car had to rest on the damp pavement; its motor spinning tinnily, it crept suspiciously toward the smouldering ruin that had been Kaplan's car. Inside the wreck the squad of men were stirring feebly, beginning to creep painfully through the tangle of steel and plastic out into the cold rain. “Consider us a protective society,” Fleming said softly, his plump, expressionless face shining with moisture. “A sort of police force that watches the police. To see,” he added, “that everything stays on an even keel.” His thick hand shot out. Stumbling, Anderton was knocked away from him, half-falling into the shadows and damp debris that littered the alley. “Get going,” Fleming told him sharply. “And don't discard that packet.” As Anderton felt his way hesitantly toward the far exit of the alley, the man's last words drifted to him. “Study it carefully and you may still survive.” V The identification cards described him as Ernest Temple, an unemployed electrician, drawing a weekly subsistence from the State of New York, with a wife and four children in Buffalo and less than a hundred dollars in assets. A sweat-stained green card gave him permission to travel and to maintain no fixed address. A man looking for work needed to travel. He might have to go a long way. As he rode across town in the almost empty bus, Anderton studied the description of Ernest Temple. Obviously, the cards had been made out with him in mind, for all the measurements fitted. After a time he wondered about the fingerprints and the brain-wave pattern. They couldn't possibly stand comparison. The walletful of cards could get him past only the most cursory examinations. But it was something. And with the ID cards came ten thousand dollars in bills. He pocketed the money and cards, then turned to the neatly-typed message in which they had been enclosed. At first he could make no sense of it. For a long time he studied it, perplexed. The existence of a majority logically implies\nA corresponding minority The bus had entered the vast slum region, the tumbled miles of cheap hotels and broken-down tenements that had sprung up after the mass destruction of the war. It slowed to a stop, and Anderton got to his feet. A few passengers idly observed his cut cheek and damaged clothing. Ignoring them, he stepped down onto the rain-swept curb. Beyond collecting the money due to him, the hotel clerk was not interested. Anderton climbed the steps to the second floor and entered the narrow, musty-smelling room that now belonged to him. Gratefully, he locked the door and pulled down the window shades. The room was small but clean. Bed, dresser, scenic calendar, chair, lamp, a radio with a slot for the insertion of quarters. He dropped a quarter into it and threw himself heavily down on the bed. All main stations carried the police bulletin. It was novel, exciting, something unknown to the present generation. An escaped criminal! The public was avidly interested. “…this man has used the advantage of his high position to carry out an initial escape,” the announcer was saying, with professional indignation. “Because of his high office he had access to previewed data and the trust placed in him permitted him to evade the normal process of detection and re-location. During the period of his tenure he exercised his authority to send countless potentially guilty individuals to their proper confinement, this sparing the lives of innocent victims. This man, John Allison Anderton, was instrumental in the original creation of the Precrime system, the prophylactic pre-detection of criminals through the ingenious use of mutant precogs, capable of previewing future events and transferring orally that data to analytical machinery. These three precogs, in their vital function…” The voice faded out as he left the room and entered the tiny bathroom. There, he stripped off his coat, and shirt, and ran hot water into the wash bowl. He began bathing the cut on his cheek. At the drugstore on the corner he had bought iodine and Band-aids, a razor, comb, toothbrush, and other small things he would need. The next morning, he intended to find a second-hand clothing store and buy more suitable clothing. After all, he was now an unemployed electrician, not an accident-damaged Commissioner of Police. In the other room the radio blared on. Only subconsciously aware of it, he stood in front of the cracked mirror, examining a broken tooth. “…the system of three precogs finds its genesis in the computers of the middle decades of this century. How are the results of an electronic computer checked? By feeding data to a second computer of identical design. But two computers are not sufficient. If each computer arrived at a different answer, it is impossible to tell a priori which is correct. The solution, based on a careful study of statistical method, is to utilize a third computer to check the results of the first two. In this manner, a so-called majority report is obtained. It can be assumed with fair probability that the agreement of two out of three computers indicates which of the alternative results is accurate. It would not be likely that two computers would arrive at identically incorrect solutions — ” Anderton dropped the towel he was clutching and raced into the other room. Trembling, he bent to catch the blaring words of the radio. “…unanimity of all three precogs is a hoped-for but seldom achieved phenomenon, acting-Commissioner Witwer explains. It is much more common to obtain a collaborative majority report of two precogs, plus a minority report of some slight variation, usually with reference to time or place, from the third mutant. This is explained by the theory of multiple-futures. If only one time-path existed, precognitive information would be of no importance, since no possibility would exist, in possessing this information, of altering the future. In the Precrime Agency's work we must first of all assume —” Frantically, Anderton paced around the tiny room. Majority report — only two of the precogs had concurred on the material underlying the card. That was the meaning of the message enclosed with the packet. The report of the third precog, the minority report, was somehow of importance. Why? His watch told him that it was after midnight. Page would be off duty. He wouldn't be back in the monkey block until the next afternoon. It was a slim chance, but worth taking. Maybe Page would cover for him, and maybe not. He would have to risk it. He had to see the minority report. VI Between noon and one o'clock the rubbish-littered streets swarmed with people. He chose that time, the busiest part of the day, to make his call. Selecting a phonebooth in a patron-teeming super drugstore, he dialled the familiar police number and stood holding the cold receiver to his ear. Deliberately, he had selected the aud, not the vid line: in spite of his second-hand clothing and seedy, unshaven appearance, he might be recognized. The receptionist was new to him. Cautiously, he gave Page's extension. If Witwer were removing the regular staff and putting in his satellites, he might find himself talking to a total stranger. “Hello,” Page's gruff voice came. Relieved, Anderton glanced around. Nobody was paying any attention to him. The shoppers wandered among the merchandise, going about their daily routines. “Can you talk?” he asked. “Or are you tied up?” There was a moment of silence. He could picture Page's mild face torn with uncertainty as he wildly tried to decide what to do. At last came the halting words. “Why — are you calling here?” Ignoring the question, Anderton said, “I didn't recognize the receptionist. New personnel?” “Brand-new,” Page agreed, in a thin, strangled voice. “Big turnovers, these days.” “So I hear.” Tensely, Anderton asked, “How's your job? Still safe?” “Wait a minute.” The receiver was put down and the muffled sound of steps can in Anderton's ear. It was followed by the quick slam of a door being hastily shut. Page returned. “We can talk better now,” he said hoarsely. “How much better?” “Not a great deal. Where are you?” “Strolling through Central Park,” Anderton said. “Enjoying the sunlight.” For all he knew, Page had gone to make sure the line-tap was in place. Right now, an airborne police team was probably on its way. But he had to take the chance. “I'm in a new field,” he said curtly. “I'm an electrician these days.” “Oh?” Page said, baffled. “I thought maybe you had some work for me. If it can be arranged, I'd like to drop by and examine your basic computing equipment. Especially the data and analytical banks in the monkey block.” After a pause, Page said: “It — might be arranged. If it's really important.” “It is,” Anderton assured him. “When would be best for you?” “Well,” Page said, struggling. “I'm having a repair team come in to look at the intercom equipment. The acting-Commissioner wants it to be improved, so he can operate quicker. You might trail along.” “I'll do that. About when?” “Say four o'clock. Entrance B, level 6. I'll — meet you.” “Fine,” Anderton agreed, already starting to hang up. “I hope you're still in charge, when I get there.” He hung up and rapidly left the booth. A moment later he was pushing through the dense pack of people crammed into the nearby cafeteria. Nobody would locate him there. He had about three and a half hours to wait. And it was going to seem a lot longer. It proved to be the longest wait of his life before he finally met Page as arranged. The first thing Page said was: “You're out of your mind. Why in hell did you come back?” “I'm not back for long.” Tautly, Anderton prowled around the monkey block, systematically locking one door after another. “Don't let anybody in. I can't take any chances.” “You should've quit when you were ahead.” In an agony of apprehension, Page followed after him. “Witwer is making hay, hand over fist. He's got the whole country screaming for your blood.” Ignoring him, Anderton snapped open the main control bank of the analytical machinery. “Which of the three monkeys gave the minority report?” “Don't question me — I'm getting out.” On his way to the door Page halted briefly, pointed to the middle figure, and then disappeared. The door closed; Anderton was alone. The middle one. He knew that one well. The dwarfed, hunched-over figure had sat buried in its wiring and relays for fifteen years. As Anderton approached, it didn't look up. With eyes glazed and blank, it contemplated a world that did not exist yet, blind to the physical reality that lay around it. “Jerry” was twenty-four years old. Originally, he had been classified as a hydrocephalic idiot but when he reached the age of six the psych testers had identified the precog talent, buried under layers of tissue corrosion. Placed in a government-operated training school, the latent talent had been cultivated. By the time he was nine the talent had advanced to a useful stage. “Jerry,” however, remained in the aimless chaos of idiocy; the burgeoning faculty had absorbed the totality of his personality. Squatting down, Anderton began disassembling the protective shields that guarded the tape-reels stored in the analytical machinery. Using schematics, he traced the leads back from the final stages of the integrated computers, to the point where “Jerry's” individual equipment branched off. Within minutes he was shakily lifting out two half-hour tapes: recent rejected data not fused with majority reports. Consulting the code chart, he selected the section of tape which referred to his particular card. A tape scanner was mounted nearby. Holding his breath, he inserted the tap, activated the transport, and listened. It took only a second. From the first statement of the report it was clear what happened. He had what he wanted; he could stop looking. “Jerry's” vision had misphased. Because of the erratic nature of precognition, he was examining a time-area slightly different from that of his companions. For him, the report that Anderton would commit a murder was an event to be integrated along with everything else. That assertion — and Anderton's reaction, was one more piece of datum. Obviously, “Jerry's” report superseded the majority report. Having been informed that he would commit a murder, Anderton would change his mind and no do so. The preview of the murder had cancelled out the murder; prophylaxis had occurred simply in his being informed. Already, a new time-path had been created. But “Jerry” was outvoted. Trembling, Anderton rewound the tape and clicked on the recording head. At high speed, he made a copy of the report, restored the original, and removed the duplicate from the transport. Here was the proof that the card was invalid: obsolete. All he had to do was show it to Witwer… His own stupidity amazed him. Undoubtedly, Witwer had seen the report; and in spite of it, had assumed the job of Commissioner, had kept the police teams out. Witwer didn't intend to back down; he wasn't concerned with Anderton's innocence. What, then, could he do? Who else would be interested? “You damn fool!” a voice behind him grated, wild with anxiety. Quickly, he turned. His wife stood at one of the doors, in her police uniform, her eyes frantic with dismay. “Don't worry,” he told her briefly, displaying the reel of tape. “I'm leaving.” Her face distorted, Lisa rushed frantically up to him. “Page said you were here, but I couldn't believe it. He shouldn't have let you in. He just doesn't understand what you are.” “What am I?” Anderton inquired caustically. “Before you answer that, maybe you better listen to this tape.” “I don't want to listen to it! I just want you to get out of here! Ed Witwer knows somebody's down here. Page is trying to keep him occupied, but — ” She broke off, her head turned stiffly to one side. “He's here now! He's going to force his way in.” “Haven't you got any influence? Be gracious and charming. He'll probably forget about me.” Lisa looked at him with bitter reproach. “There's a ship parked on the roof. If you want to get away…” Her voice choked and for an instant she was silent. Then she said, “I'll be taking off in a minute or so. If you want to come — ” “I'll come,” Anderton said. He had no other choice. He had secured his tap, his proof, but he hadn't worked out any method of leaving. Gladly, he hurried after the slim figure of his wife as she strode from the block, through a side door and down a supply corridor, her heels clicking loudly in the deserted gloom. “It's a good fast ship,” she told him over her shoulder. “It's emergency-fuelled — ready to go. I was going to supervise some of the teams.” VII Behind the wheel of the high-velocity police cruiser, Anderton outlined what the minority report tape contained. Lisa listened without comment, her face pinched and strained, her hands clasped tensely in her lap. Below the ship, the war-ravaged rural countryside spread out like a relief map, the vacant regions between cities crater-pitted and dotted with the ruins of farms and small industrial plants. “I wonder,” she said, when he had finished, “how many times this has happened before.” “A minority report? A great many times.” “I mean, one precog misphased. Using the report of the others as data — superseding them.” Her eyes dark and serious, she added, “Perhaps a lot of the people in the camps are like you.” “No,” Anderton insisted. But he was beginning to feel uneasy about it, too. “ I was in a position to see the card, to get a look at the report. That's what did it.” “But — ” Lisa gestured significantly. “Perhaps all of them would have reacted that way. We could have told them the truth.” “It would have been far too great a risk,” he answered stubbornly. Lisa laughed sharply. “Risk? Chance? Uncertainty? With the precogs around?” Anderton concentrated on steering the fast little ship. “This is a unique case,” he repeated. “And we have an immediate problem. We can tackle the theoretical aspects later on. I have to get this tape to the proper people — before your bright young friend demolishes it.” “You're taking it to Kaplan?” “I certainly am.” He tapped the reel of tape which lay on the seat between them. “He'll be interested. Proof that his life isn't in danger ought to be of vital concern to him.” From her purse, Lisa shakily got out her cigarette case. “And you think he'll help you.” “He may — or he may not. It's a chance worth taking.” “How did you manage to go underground so quickly?” Lisa asked. “A completely effective disguise is difficult to obtain.” “All it takes is money,” he answered evasively. As she smoked, Lisa pondered. “Probably Kaplan will protect you,” she said. “He's quite powerful. “I thought he was only a retired general.” “Technically — that's what he is. But Witwer got out the dossier on him. Kaplan heads an unusual kind of exclusive veteran's organization. It's actually a kind of club, with a few restricted members. High officers only — an international class from both sides of the war. Here in New York they maintain a great mansion of a house, three glossy-paper productions, and occasional TV coverage that costs them a small fortune.” “What are you trying to say?” “Only this. You've convinced me that you're innocent. I mean, it's obvious that you won't commit a murder. But you must realize now that the original report, the majority report, was not a fake. Nobody falsified it. Ed Witwer didn't create it. There's no plot against you, and there never was. If you're going to accept the minority report as genuine you'll have to accept the majority one, also.” Reluctantly, he agreed. “I suppose so.” “Ed Witwer,” Lisa continued, “is acting in complete good faith. He really believes you're a potential criminal — and why not? He's got the majority report sitting on his desk, but you have that card folded up in your pocket.” “I destroyed it,” Anderton said, quietly. Lisa leaned earnestly toward him. “Ed Witwer isn't motivated by any desire to get your job,” she said. “He's motivated by the same desire that has always dominated you. He believes in Precrime. He wants the system to continue. I've talked to him and I'm convinced he's telling the truth.” Anderton asked, “Do you want me to take this reel to Witwer? If I do — he'll destroy it.” “Nonsense,” Lisa retorted, “The originals have been in his hands from the start. He could have destroyed them any time he wished.” “That's true,” Anderton conceded. “Quite possibly he didn't know.” “Of course he didn't. Look at it this way. If Kaplan gets hold of that tape, the police will be discredited. Can't you see why? It would prove that the majority report was in error. Ed Witwer is absolutely right. You have to be taken in — if Precrime is to survive. You're thinking of your own safety. But think, for a moment, about the system.” Leaning over, she stubbed out her cigarette and fumbled in her purse for another. “Which means more to you — your own personal safety or the existence of the system?” “My safety,” Anderton answered, without hesitation. “You're positive?” “If the system can survive only by imprisoning innocent people, then it deserves to be destroyed. My personal safety is important because I'm a human being. And furthermore — ” From her purse, Lisa got out an incredibly tiny pistol. “I believe,” she told him huskily, “that I have my finger on the firing release. I've never used a weapon like this before. But I'm willing to try.” After a pause, Anderton asked: “You want me to turn the ship around? Is that it?” “Yes, back to the police building. I'm sorry. If you could put the good of the system above your own selfish — ” “Keep your sermon,” Anderton told her. “I'll take the ship back. But I'm not going to listen to your defence of a code of behaviour that no intelligent man could subscribe to.” Lisa's lips pressed into a thin, bloodless line. Holding the pistol tightly, she sat facing him, her eyes fixed intently on him as he swung the ship in a broad arc. A few loose articles rattled from the glove compartment as the little craft turned on a radical slant, on wing rising majestically until it point straight up. Both Anderton and his wife were supported by the constraining metal arms of their seats. But not so the third member of the party. Out of the corner of his eye, Anderton saw a flash of motion. A sound came simultaneously, the clawing struggle of a large man as he abruptly lost his footing and plunged into the reinforced wall of the ship. What followed happed quickly. Fleming scrambled instantly to his feet, lurching and wary, one arm lashing out for the woman's pistol. Anderton was too startled to cry out. Lisa turned, saw the man — and screamed. Fleming knocked the gun from her hand, sending it clattering to the floor. Grunting, Fleming shoved her aside and retrieved the gun. “Sorry,” he gasped, straightening up as best he could. “I thought she might talk more. That's why I waited.” “You were here when — ” Anderton began — and stopped. It was obvious that Fleming and his men had kept him under surveillance. The existence of Lisa's ship had been duly noted and factored in, and while Lisa had debated whether it would be wise to fly him to safety, Fleming had crept into the storage compartment of the ship. “Perhaps,” Fleming said, “you'd better give me that reel of tape.” His moist clumsy fingers groped for it. “You're right — Witwer would've melted it down to a puddle.” “Kaplan, too?” Anderton asked numbly, still dazed by the appearance of the man. “Kaplan is working with Witwer. That's why his name showed on line five of the card. Which one of them is the actual boss, we can't tell. Possibly neither.” Fleming tossed the tiny pistol away and gout out his own heavy-duty military weapon. “You pulled a real flub in taking off with this woman. I told you she was back of the whole thing.” “I can't believe that,” Anderton protested. “If she — ” “You've got no sense. This ship was warmed up by Witwer's order. They wanted to fly you out of the building so that we couldn't get to you. With you on your own, separated from us, you didn't stand a chance.” A strange look passed over Lisa's stricken features. “It's not true,” she whispered. “Witwer never saw this ship. I was going to supervise — ” “You almost got away with it,” Fleming interrupted inexorably. “We'll be luck if a police patrol ship isn't hanging on us. There wasn't time to check.” He squatted down as he spoke, directly behind the woman's chair. “The first thing is to get this woman out of the way. We'll have to drag you completely out of this area. Page tipped off Witwer on your new disguise, and you can be sure is has been widely broadcast.” Still crouching, Fleming seized hold of Lisa. Tossing his heavy gun to Anderton, he expertly tilted her chin up until her temple was shoved back against the seat. Lisa clawed frantically at him; a thin, terrified wail rose in her throat. Ignoring her, Fleming closed his great hands around her neck and began relentlessly to squeeze. “No bullet wound,” he explained, gasping. “She's going to fall out — natural accident. It happens all the time. But in this case, her neck will be broken first.” It seemed strange that Anderton waited so long. As it was, Fleming's thick fingers were cruelly imbedded in the woman's pale flesh before he lifted the butt of the heavyduty pistol and brought it down on the back of Fleming's skull. The monstrous hands relaxed. Staggered, Fleming's head fell forward and he sagged against the wall of the ship. Trying feebly to collect himself, he began dragging his body upward. Anderton hit him again, this time above the left eye. He fell back, and lay still. Struggling to breathe, Lisa remained for a moment huddled over, her body swaying back and forth. Then, gradually, colour crept back into her face. “Can you take the controls?” Anderton asked, shaking her, his voice urgent. “Yes, I think so.” Almost mechanically she reached for the wheel. “I'll be all right. Don't worry about me.” “This pistol is Army ordnance issue. But it's not from the way. It's one of the useful new ones they've developed. I could be a long way off but there's just a chance — ” He climbed back to where Fleming lay spread out on the deck. Trying not to touch the man's head, he tore open his coat and rummaged in his pockets. A moment later, Fleming's sweat-sodden wallet rested in his hands. Tod Fleming, according to his identification, was an Army Major attached to the Internal Intelligence Department of Military Information. Among the various papers was a document signed by General Leopold Kaplan, stating that Fleming was under special protection of his own group — the International Veteran's League. Fleming and his men were operating under Kaplan's orders. The bread truck, the accident, had been deliberately rigged. It meant that Kaplan had deliberately kept him out of police hands. The plan went back to the original contact in his home, when Kaplan's men had picked him up as he was packing. Incredulous, he realized what had really happened. Even then, they were making sure they got him before the police. From the start, it had been an elaborate strategy to make certain that Witwer would fail to arrest him. “You were telling the truth,” Anderton said to his wife, as he climbed back in the seat. “Can we get hold of Witwer?” Mutely, she nodded. Indicating the communications circuit of the dashboard, she asked: “What — did you find?” “Get Witwer for me. I want to talk to him as soon as I can. It's very urgent.” Jerkily, she dialled, got the closed-channel mechanical circuit, and raised police headquarters in New York. A visual panorama of petty police officials flashed by before a tiny replica of Ed Witwer's features appeared on the screen.” “Remember me?” Anderton asked him. Witwer blanched. “Good God. What happened? Lisa, are you bringing him in?” Abruptly, his eyes fastened on the gun in Anderton's hands. “Look,” he said savagely, “don't do anything to her. Whatever you may think, she's not responsible.” “I've already found that out,” Anderton answered. “Can you get a fix on us? We may need protection getting back.” “Back!” Witwer gazed at him unbelievingly. “You're coming in? You're giving yourself up?” “I am, yes.” Speaking rapidly, urgently, Anderton added, “There's something you must do immediately. Close off the monkey block. Make certain nobody gets in — Page or anyone else. Especially Army people.” “Kaplan,” the miniature image said. “What about him?” “He was here. He — he just left.” Anderton's heart stopped beating. “What was he doing?” “Picking up data. Transcribing duplicates of our precog reports on you. He insisted he wanted them solely for his protection.” “Then he's already got it,” Anderton said. “It's too late.” Alarmed, Witwer almost shouted: “Just what do you mean? What's happening?” “I'll tell you,” Anderton said heavily, when I get back to my office.” VIII Witwer met him on the roof of the police building. As the small ship came to rest, a cloud of escort ships dipped their fins and sped off. Anderton immediately approached the blond-haired young man. “You've got what you wanted,” he told him. “You can lock me up, and send me to the detention camp. But that won't be enough.” Witwer's blue eyes were pale with uncertainty. “I'm afraid I don't understand — ” “It's not my fault. I should never have left the police building. Where's Wally Page.” “We've already clamped down on him,” Witwer replied. “He won't give us any trouble.' Anderton's face was grim. “You're holding him for the wrong reason,” he said. “Letting me into the monkey block was no crime. But passing information to the Army is. You've had an Army plant working here.” He corrected himself, a little lamely, “I mean, I have.” “I've called back the order on you. Now the teams are looking for Kaplan.” “Any luck?” “He left here in an Army truck. We followed him, but the truck got into a militarised Barracks. Now they've got a big wartime R-3 tank blocking the street. It would be civil war to move it aside.” Slowly, hesitantly, Lisa made her way from the ship. She was still pale and shaken and on her throat an ugly bruise was forming. “What happened to you?” Witwer demanded. Then he caught sight of Fleming's inert form lying spread out inside. Facing Anderton squarely, he said: “Then you've finally stopped pretending this is some conspiracy of mine.” “I have.” “You don't think I'm — ” He made a disgusted face. “ Plotting to get your job.” “Sure you are. Everybody is guilty of that sort of thing. And I'm plotting to keep it. But this is something else — and you're not responsible.” “Why do you assert,” Witwer inquired, “that it's too late to turn yourself in? My God, we'll put you in the camp. The week will pass and Kaplan will still be alive.” “He'll be alive, yes,” Anderton conceded. “But he can proved he'd be just as alive if I were walking the streets. He has the information that proves the majority report obsolete. He can break the Precrime system.” He finished, “Heads or tails, he wins — and we lose. The Army discredits us; their strategy paid off.” “But why are they risking so much? What exactly do they want?” “After the Anglo-Chinese War, the Army lost out. It isn't what it was in the good old AFWA days. They ran the complete show, both military and domestic. And they did their own police work.” “Like Fleming,” Lisa said faintly. “After the war, the Westbloc was demilitarised. Officers like Kaplan were retired and discarded. Nobody likes that.” Anderton grimaced. “I can sympathize with him. He's not the only one. But we couldn't keep on running things that way. We had to divide up authority.” “You say Kaplan has won,” Witwer said. “Isn't there anything we can do?” “I'm not going to kill him. We know it and he knows it. Probably he'll come around and offer us some kind of deal. We'll continue to function, but the Senate will abolish our real pull. You wouldn't like that, would you?” “I should say not,” Witwer answered emphatically. “One of these days I'm going to be running this agency.” He flushed. “Not immediately, of course.” Anderton's expression was sombre. “It's too bad you publicized the majority report. If you had kept it quiet, we could cautiously draw it back in. But everybody's heard about it. We can't retract it now.” “I guess not,” Witwer admitted awkwardly. “Maybe I — don't have this job down as neatly as I imagined.” “You will, in time. You'll be a good police officer. You believe in the status quo. But learn to take it easy.” Anderton moved away from them. “I'm going to study the data tapes of the majority report. I want to find out exactly how I was supposed to kill Kaplan.” Reflectively, he finished: “It might give me some ideas.” The data tapes of the precogs “Donna” and “Mike” were separately stored. Choosing the machinery responsible for the analysis of “Donna,” he opened the protective shield and laid out the contents. As before, the code informed him which reels were relevant and in a moment he had the tape-transport mechanism in operation. It was approximately what he had suspected. This was the material utilized by “Jerry” — the superseded time-path. In it Kaplan's Military Intelligence agents kidnapped Anderton as he drove home from work. Taking to Kaplan's villa, the organization GHQ of the International Veteran's League. Anderton was given an ultimatum: voluntarily disband the Precrime system or face open hostilities with the Army. In this discarded time-path, Anderton, as Police Commissioner, had turned to the Senate for support. No support was forthcoming. To avoid civil war, the Senate ratified the dismemberment of the police system, and decreed a return to military law “to cope with the emergency.” Taking a corps of fanatical police, Anderton had located Kaplan and shot him, along with other officials of the Veteran's League. Only Kaplan had died. The others had been patched up. And the coup had been successful. This was “Donna.” He rewound the tape and turned to the material previewed by “Mike.” It would be identical; both precogs had combined to present a unified picture. “Mike” began as “Donna” had begun: Anderton had become aware of Kaplan's plot against the police. But something was wrong. Puzzled, he ran the tape back to the beginning. Incomprehensibly, it didn't jibe. Again he relayed the tape, listening intently. The “Mike” report was quite different from the “Donna” report. And hour later, he had finished his examination, put away the tapes, and left the monkey block. As soon as he emerged, Witwer asked. “What's the matter? I can see something's wrong.” “No,” Anderton answered slowly, still deep in thought. “Not exactly wrong.” A sound came to his ears. He walked vaguely over to the window and peered out. The street was crammed with people. Moving down the centre lane was a four-column line of uniformed troops. Rifles, helmets…marching soldiers in their dingy wartime uniforms, carrying the cherished pennants of AFWA flapping in the cold afternoon wind. “An army rally,” Witwer explained bleakly. “I was wrong. They're not going to make a deal with us. Why should they? Kaplan's going to make it public.” Anderton felt no surprise. “He's going to read the minority report?” “Apparently. They're going to demand the Senate disband us, and take away our authority. They're going to claim we've been arresting innocent men — nocturnal police raids, that sort of thing. Rule by terror,” “You suppose the Senate will yield?” Witwer hesitated. “I wouldn't want to guess.” “I'll guess,” Anderton said. “They will. That business out there fits with what I learned downstairs. We've got ourselves boxed in and there's only one direction we can go. Whether we like it or not, we'll have to take it.” His eyes had a steely glint. “But,” Witwer said, astonished, “the majority report has been superseded.” “I can do it,” Anderton informed him, “but it's going to cost. You're familiar with the statutes governing first-degree murder?” “Life imprisonment.” “At least. Probably, you could pull a few wires and get it commuted to exile. I could be set to one of the colony planets, the good old frontier.” “Would you — prefer that?” “Hell, no,” Anderton said heartily. “But it would be the lesser of the two evils. And it's got to be done.” “I don't see how you can kill Kaplan.” Anderton got out the heavy-duty military weapon Fleming had tossed to him. “I'll use this.” “They won't stop you?” “Why should they? They've got that minority report that says I've changed my mind.” “Then the minority report is incorrect?” “No,” Anderton said, “it's absolutely corrected. But I'm going to murder Kaplan anyhow.” IX He had never killed a man. He had never even seen a man killed. And he had been Police Commissioner for thirty years. For this generation, deliberate murder had died out. It simply didn't happen. A police car barrier carried him to within a block of the Army rally. There, in the shadows of the back seat, he painstakingly examined the pistol Fleming had provided him. It seemed to be intact. Actually, he had no doubt of the outcome. He was absolutely certain of what would happen within the next half hour. Putting the pistol back together, he opened the door of the parked car and stepped warily out. Nobody paid the slightest attention to him. Surging masses of people pushed eagerly forward, trying to get within hearing distance of the rally. Army uniforms predominated and at the perimeter of the clear area, a line of tanks and major weapons was displayed — formidable armament still in production. Army had erected a metal speaker's stand and ascending steps. Behind the stand hung the vast AFWA banner, emblem of the combined powers that had fought in the war. By a curious corrosion of time, the AFWA Veteran's League included officers from the wartime enemy. But a general was a general and fine distinctions had faded over the years. Occupying the first rows of seats sat the high brass of the AFWA command. Behind them came junior commissioned officers. Regimental banners swirled in a variety of colours and symbols. In fact, the occasion had taken on the aspect of a festive pageant. On the raised stand itself sat stern-faced dignitaries of the Veteran's League, all of them tense with expectancy. At the extreme edges, almost unnoticed, waited a few police units, ostensibly to keep the peace. Actually, they were informants making observations. If order were kept, the Army would maintain it. The late-afternoon winder carried the muffled booming of many people packed tightly together. As Anderton made his way through the dense mod he was engulfed by the solid presence of humanity. An eager sense of anticipation held everybody rigid. The crowd seemed to sense that something spectacular was on the way. With difficulty, Anderton forced his way past rows of seats and over to the tight knot of Army officials at the edge of the platform. Kaplan was among them. But he was now General Kaplan. The vest, the gold pocket watch, the cane, the conservative business suit — all were gone. For this event, Kaplan had got his old uniform from its mothballs. Straight and impressive, he stood surrounded by what had been his general staff. He wore his service bars, his medals, his boots, his decorative short-sword, and his visored cap. It was amazing how transformed a bald man became under the stark potency of an officer's peaked and visored cap. Noticing Anderton, General Kaplan broke away from the group and strode to where the younger man was standing. The expression on his thin, mobile countenance showed how incredulously glad he was to see the Commissioner of Police. “This is a surprise,” he informed Anderton, holding out his small grey-gloved hand. “It was my impression you had been taken in by the acting Commissioner.” “I'm still out,” Anderton answered shortly, shaking hands. “After all, Witwer has that same reel of tape.” He indicated the package Kaplan clutched in his steely fingers and met the man's gaze confidently. In spite of his nervousness, General Kaplan was in good humour. “This is a great occasion for the Army,” he revealed. “You'll be glad to hear I'm going to give the public a full account of the spurious charge brought against you.” “Fine,” Anderton answered noncommittally. “It will be made clear that you were unjustly accused.” General Kaplan was trying to discover what Anderton knew. “Did Fleming have an opportunity to acquaint you with the situation?” “To some degree,” Anderton replied. “You're going to read only the minority report? That's all you've got there?” “I'm going to compare it to the majority report.” General Kaplan signalled an aide and a leather briefcase was produced. “Everything is there — all the evidence we need,” he said. “You don't mind being an example, do you? Your case symbolizes the unjust arrests of countless individuals.” Stiffly, General Kaplan examined his wristwatch. “I must begin. Will you join me on the platform?” “Why?” Coldly, but with a kind of repressed vehemence, General Kaplan said: “So they can see the living proof. You and I together — the killer and his victim. Standing side by side, exposing the whole sinister fraud which the police have been operating.” “Gladly,” Anderton agreed. “What are we waiting for?” Disconcerted, General Kaplan moved toward the platform. Again, he glanced uneasily at Anderton, as if visibly wondering why he had appeared and what he really knew. His uncertainty grew as Anderton willingly mounted the steps of the platform and found himself a seat directly beside the speaker's podium. “You fully comprehend what I'm going to say?” General Kaplan demanded. “The exposure will have considerable repercussions. It may cause the Senate to reconsider the basic validity of the Precrime system.” “I understand,” Anderton answered, arms folded. “Let's go.” A hush had descended on the crowd. But there was a restless, eager stirring when General Kaplan obtained the briefcase and began arranging his material in front of him. “The man sitting at my side,” he began, in a clean, clipped voice, “is familiar to you all. You may be surprised to see him, for until recently was described by the police as a dangerous killer.” The eyes of the crowd focused on Anderton. Avidly, they peered at the only potential killer they had ever been privileged to see at close range. “Within the last few hours, however,” General Kaplan continued, “the police order for his arrest has been cancelled; because former Commissioner Anderton voluntarily gave himself up? No, that is not strictly accurate. He is sitting here. He has not given himself up, but the police are no longer interested in him. John Allison Anderton is innocent of any crime in the past, present, and future. The allegations against him were patent frauds, diabolical distortions of a contaminated penal system based on a false premise — a vast, impersonal engine of destruction grinding men and women to their doom,” Fascinated, the crowd glanced from Kaplan to Anderton. Everyone was familiar with the basic situation. “Many men have been seized and imprisoned under the so-called prophylactic Precrime structure,” General Kaplan continued, his voice gaining feeling and strength. “Accused not of crimes they have committed, but of crimes they will commit. It is asserted that these men, if allowed to remain free, will at some future time commit felonies.” “But there can be no valid knowledge about the future. As soon as precognitive information is obtained, it cancels itself out. The assertion that this man will commit a future crime is paradoxical. The very act of possessing this data renders it spurious. In every case, without exception, the report of the three police precogs had invalidated their own data. If no arrests had been made, there would still have been no crimes committed.” Anderton listen idly, only half-hearing the words. The crowd, however, listened with great interest. General Kaplan was now gathering up a summary made from the minority report. He explained what it was and how it had come into existence. From his coat pocket, Anderton slipped out his gun and held it in his lap. Already, Kaplan was laying aside the minority report, the precognitive material obtained from “Jerry.” His lean, bony fingers groped for the summary of first, “Donna,” and after that, “Mike.” “This was the original majority report,” he explained. “The assertion, made by the first two precogs, that Anderton would commit a murder. Now here is the automatically invalidated material. I shall read it to you.” He whipped out his rimless glasses, fitted them to his nose, and started slowly to read. A queer expression appeared on his face. He halted, stammered, and abruptly broke off. The papers fluttered from his hands. Like a cornered animal, he spun, crouched, and dashed from the speaker's stand. For an instant his distorted face flashed past Anderton. On his feet now, Anderton raised the gun, stepped quickly forward, and fired. Tangled up in the rows of feet projecting from the stairs that filled the platform, Kaplan gave a single shrill shriek of agony and fright. Like a ruined bird, he tumbled, fluttering and flailing, from the platform to the ground below. Anderton stepped to the railing, but it was already over. Kaplan, as the majority report had asserted, was dead. His thin chest was a smoking cavity of darkness, crumbling ash that broke loose as the body lay twitching. Sickened, Anderton turned away, and moved quickly between the rising figures of stunned Army officers. The gun, which he still held, guaranteed that he would not be interfered with. He leaped from the platform and edged his way into the chaotic mass of people at its base. Stricken, horrified, they struggled to see what had happened. It would take time for acceptance to replace blind terror. At the periphery of the crowd, Anderton was seized by the waiting police. “You're lucky to get out,” one of them whispered to him as the car crept cautiously ahead. “I guess I am,” Anderton replied remotely. He settled back and tried to compose himself. He was trembling and dizzy. Abruptly, he leaned forward and was violently sick. “The poor devil,” one of the cops murmured sympathetically. Through the swirls of misery and nausea, Anderton was unable to tell whether the cop was referring to Kaplan or to himself. X Four burly policemen assisted Lisa and John Anderton in the packing and loading of their possessions. In fifty years, the ex-Commissioner of Police had accumulated a vast collection of material goods. Sombre and pensive, he stood watching the procession of crates on their way to the waiting trucks. By truck they would go directly to the field — and from there to Centaurus X by intersystem transport. A long trip for an old man. But he wouldn't have to make it back. “There goes the second to last crate,” Lisa declared, absorbed and preoccupied by the task. In sweater and slacks, she roamed through the barren rooms, checking on last-minute details. “I suppose we won't be able to use these new atronic appliances. They're still using electricity on Centten.” “I hope you don't care too much,” Anderton said. “We'll get used to it,” Lisa replied and gave him a fleeting smile. “Won't we?” “I hope so. You're positive you'll have no regrets? If I though — ” “No regrets,” Lisa assured him. “Now suppose you help me with this crate.” As they boarded the lead truck, Witwer drove up in a patrol car. He leaped out and hurried up to them, his face looking strangely haggard. “Before you take off,” he said to Anderton, “you'll have to give me a break- down on the situation with the precogs. I'm getting inquiries from the Senate. They want to find out if the middle report, the retraction, was an error — or what.” Confusedly, he finished. “I still can't explain it. The minority report was wrong, wasn't it?” “Which minority report?” Anderton inquired, amused. Witwer blinked. “Then that is it. I might have known.” Seated in the cabin of the truck, Anderton got out his pipe and shook tobacco into it. With Lisa's lighter he ignited the tobacco and began operations. Lisa had gone back to the house, wanting to be sure nothing vital had been overlooked. “There were three minority reports,” he told Witwer, enjoying the young man's confusion. Someday, Witwer would learn not to wade into situations he didn't fully understand. Satisfaction was Anderton's final emotion. Old and worn-out as he was, he had been the only one to grasp the real nature of the problem. “The three reports were consecutive,” he explained. “The first was 'Donna.' In that time-path, Kaplan told me of the plot, and I promptly murdered him. 'Jerry' phased slightly ahead of 'Donna,' used her report as data. He factored in my knowledge of the report. In that, the second time-path, all I wanted to do was keep my job. It wasn't Kaplan I wanted to kill. It was my own position and life I was interested in.” “And 'Mike' was the third report? That came after the minority report?” Witwer corrected himself. “I mean, it came last?” “'Mike' was the last of the three, yes. Faced with the knowledge of the first report, I decided not to kill Kaplan. That produced report two. But faced with that report, I changed my mind back. Report two, situation two, was the situation Kaplan wanted to create. It was to the advantage of the police to recreate position one. And by that time I was thinking of the police. I had figured out what Kaplan was doing. The third report invalidated the second one in the same way the second one invalidated the first. That brought us back where we started from.” Lisa came over, breathless and gasping. “Let's go — we're all finished here.” Lithe and agile, she ascended the metal rungs of the truck and squeezed in beside her husband and the driver. The latter obediently started the truck and others followed. “Each report was different,” Anderton concluded. “Each was unique. But two of them agreed on one point. If left free, I would kill Kaplan. That created the illusion of a majority report. Actually, that's all it was — an illusion. 'Donna' and 'Mike' previewed the same event — but in two totally different time paths, occurring under totally different situations. 'Donna' and 'Jerry,' the so-called minority report and half of the majority report, were incorrect. Of the three, 'Mike' was correct — since no report came after his, to invalidate him. That sums it up.” Anxiously, Witwer trotted along beside the truck, his smooth, blond face creased with worry. “Will it happen again? Should we overhaul the set-up?” “It can happen only in one circumstance,” Anderton said. “My case was unique, since I had access to the data. It could happen again — but only to the next Police Commissioner. So watch your step.” Briefly, he grinned, deriving no inconsiderable comfort from Witwer's strained expression. Beside him, Lisa's red lips twitched and her hand reached out and closed over his. “Better keep your eyes open,” he informed young Witwer. “It might happen to you at any time.” From https://archive.org/details/minorityreport0000dick_t3e3 "},{"id":26,"href":"/site/library/bradbury-the-night/","title":"The Night (or \"Ice Cream on a Summer's Evening\")","section":"Library","content":"Night is more than darkness; it is life and death and all things beyond our feeble knowledges\nYou are a child in a small town. You are, to be exact, eight years old, and it is growing late at night. Late, for you, accustomed to bedding in at nine or nine-thirty; once in a while perhaps begging Mom or Dad to let you stay up later to hear Sam and Henry on that strange radio that was popular in this year of 1927. But most of the time you are in bed and snug at this time of night.\nIt is a warm summer evening. You live in a small house on a small street in the outer part of town where there are few street lights. There is only one store open, about a block away. Mrs. Singer's. In the hot evening Mother has been ironing the Monday washing and you have been intermittently begging for ice cream.\nYour Mother and yourself are all alone at home in the warm darkness of summer.\nFinally, just before it is time for Mrs. Singer to close her store, Mother relents and tells you to:\n\"Run and get a pine of ice cream and be sure she packs it tight.”\nYou ask if you can get a scoop of chocolate ice cream put on top, because you don't like vanilla, and Mother agrees. You clutch the money and run barefooted over the warm evening cement sidewalk, under the apple trees and oak trees toward the store. The city is so quiet and far off, you can hear the crickets sounding in the spaces beyond the hot indigo trees that hold back the stars.\nYour bare feet slap on the pavement, you cross the street and, a lonely little boy, find Mrs. Singer moving ponderously about her business, singing Yiddish melodies.\n“Pint ice cream. Chocolate on top. Yes,” she says.\nYou watch her fumble the metal top off the ice-cream freezer and manipulate the scoop, packing the cardboard pint chock full with \"chocolate on top, yes.” You give the money, receive the chill, icy pack, and rubbing it across your brow and cheek, laughing, you thump barefootedly homeward. Behind you, the lights of the lonely little store blink out and there is only a street light shimmering on the corner, and the whole city seems to be going to sleep. . . .\nOpening the screen door, you find Mother still ironing. She looks hot and irritated, but she smiles just the same.\n\"When will father be back from lodgemeeting,” you ask.\n\"About eleven-thirty or twelve,” Mother replies. She takes the ice cream to the kitchen and divides it. She gives you your special portion of chocolate, dishes out some for herself and puts the rest of it away, \"We'll save some for Skipper and your father.”\nSkipper is your brother. He is your older brother. Twelve years old he is, and healthy, red-faced, hawk-nosed and tawny-haired. Broad-shouldered for his years and always running. He is allowed to stay up later than you. Not much later, but enough to make him feel it is worth while being born first. He is over on the other side of town this evening to a game of kick-the-can and will be home soon. He and the older kids have been yelling and kicking and running all evening, having fun. Soon he will come clomping in, smelling of sweat and green grass on his knees where he fell, and smelling very much in all ways like Skipper; which is natural.\nYou sit and enjoy the ice cream. You are at the core of the deep dark summer night. Your Mother and yourself and the night all around this little house on this little street. You lick each spoon of ice cream thoroughly before digging for another, and Mother puts her ironing board away and the hot iron in its case, and she sits in the armchair by the phonograph, eating her dessert and saying, \"My lands, it was a hot day today. It's still hot. Earth soaks up all the heat and lets it out at night. It'll be soggy sleeping tonight.”\nYou both sit there listening to the summer silence. The darkness is pressed down by every window and door, with the stars holding up the rest of the universe. There is no sound. The radio needs a new battery, and you have played all the Knickerbocker Quartet records and A1 Jolson and the Two Black Crow records to exhaustion; so you just sit on the hardwood floor by the door and look out into the dark dark dark, pressing your nose against the screen until the flesh of its tip is moulded into small dark squares.\n\"I wonder where your brother is?” Mother says after a while. Her spoon scrapes on the dish. \"He should be home by now. It's almost nine-thirty.”\n“He'll be here,” you say, knowing very well that he will be.\nYou follow Mom out to wash the dishes and put them in the cupboard. Each sound, each rattle of spoon or dish, is amplified in the baked evening. Silently, you go to the living room again, take the cushions off the couch and, together, yank it open and extend it down into the double bed that it secretly is. Mother makes the bed, punching the pillows neatly to flump them up for your head and then, as you are unbuttoning your shirt, she says:\n\"Wait a while, Doug.”\n\"Why?”\n\"Because. I say so.”\n“You look funny. Mom.”\nMom sits down a moment and then gets up and goes to the door and calls. You listen to her calling and calling Skipper, Skipper, Skiiiiiiiperrrrrrrr over and over. Her calling goes out into the summer warm dark and never comes back. The echoes pay no attention.\nSkipper. Skipper. Skipper.\nSkipper!\nAnd as you sit on the floor a coldness that is not ice cream and not winter, and not part of the heat of summer, goes through you. You notice tlie way Mover's eyes slide and blink and the way she stands undecided and is kind of nervous. All of these things—\nMother opens the screen door. She steps out into the night and walks off the porch, down the steps, and down the walk about fifty feet. You listen to her feet moving.\nShe calls again. Silence.\nShe calls twice more. You sit in the room, listening. Any moment now Skipper will reply, from down the long, long narrow street:\n\"All right. Mom! All right. Mother! Coming!”\nBut he doesn't answer. And for two minutes you sit there looking at the made-up bed, the silent radio, the silent phonograph, at the chandelier with the crystal bobbins on it, at the rug with the scarlet and blue curlicues on it. You stub your toe on the edge of the bed purposely to see how much it hurts. Quite a bit.\nWhining, the screen door opens, and Mother says:\n\"Come on. Shorts. We'll take a walk.”\n\"Where to?”\n\"Just down the block. Come on. Better put your shoes on, though. You'll catch cold.”\n\"No, I won't. I'll be all right.”\nYou take her hand and together you walk down St. James Street. You smell lilacs in blossom; fallen apples lying crushed and odorous in the deep grass. Underfoot, the concrete is still warm; and the crickets are sounding louder against the darkening dark. You reach a corner, turn, and walk toward the ravine.\nOff somewhere, a car goes by, flashing its lights in the distance. There is such a complete lack of life, light and activity. Here and there, back off from where you are walking toward the ravine, you see faint squares of light where people are still up. But most of the houses, darkened, are sleeping already, and there are a few lightless places where the occupants of a dwelling sit talking low dark talk on their front porches. You hear a porch swing squeaking as you walk past.\n\"I wish your father was home,” says Mother. Her large hand tightens around your small one. \"Just wait'll I get that boy. I'll spank him within an inch of his life.”\nThere is a razor strop in the kitchen for this. You think about it, remembering when Dad has doubled it, flourished it with muscled control over and across your leaping flanks. You doubt whether Mother will carry out her promise.\nNow you have walked another block and are standing by the holy black silhouette of the German Baptist Church at the corner of Chapel Street and Glen Rock. In back of the church a hundred yards, the ravine begins. You can smell it. It has a dank sewer, rotten foliage, dark green odor. It is a wide ravine that cuts and twists across the town, a jungle by day; a place to let alone at night, Mother has often declared.\nYou should feel encouraged by the nearness of the German Baptist Church, but you are not — because the building is not illumined, is cold and useless as a skeleton hulk brooding on the ravine's lip.\nYou are only eight years old and you know little of death and fear and dread. Death is the waxen effigy in the coffin when you were six and your Grandfather passed away; looking like a great fallen vulture in his coffin, silent withdrawn, no more to tell you how to be a good boy, no more to comment succinctly upon politics. Death is your little sister one morning when you awaken at the age of seven, look into her crib and see her staring up at you with a blind blue, fixed and frozen stare until the men came with a small wicker basket to take her away. Death is when you stand by her high-chair four weeks later and suddenly realize she will never be in it again, laughing or crying and making you jealous of her because she was born. That is death.\nBut this is more than death. This summer night wading deep in time and stars and warm eternity. It is an essence of all the things you will ever feel or see or hear in your life again, being brought steadily home to you all at once.\nLeaving the sidewalk, you walk along a trodden, pebbled, weed-fringed path to the ravine's edge. Crickets, in loud full drumming chorus now, are shouting to quiver the dead. You follow obediently behind brave, fine, tall Mother who is defender of all the universe. You feel braveness because she goes before, and you hang back a trifle for a moment, and then hurry on, too. Together, then, you approach, reach and pause at the very edge of civilization.\nThe ravine.\nHere and now, down there in that pit of jungled blackness is suddenly all the evil you will ever know. Evil you will never understand. All of the nameless things are there. Later, when you have grown you will be given names to label them with. Ghosts, leprechauns, trolls, goblins, spirits; pitiful epithets, meaningless syllables to describe the waiting gloom. Down there in the huddled shadows, among the thick tree trunks and trailing vines, lives the odor of decay. Here, at this place, civilization ends, reason ends, and a universal evil takes over.\nYou realize you are alone. Yourself and your Mother. Her hand trembles.\nHer hand trembles.\nYour belief in your private world is shattered. You feel your Mother tremble. Why does she do that? Is she, too, doubtful? But is she not bigger, stronger, more intelligent than yourself? Does she, too, feel that intangible menace, that groping out of darkness, that crouching malignancy down below? Is there, then, no strength in growing up, no solace in being an adult, no sanctuary any place in life, no flesh citadel strong enough to withstand the scrabbling assault of midnights? Doubts flush your mind. Ice cream lives again in your throat, stomach, spine and limbs; you are instantly cold as a wind out of December-gone.\nYou realize that all men are like this. That each man is to himself one alone. One oneness, a unit in a society, but always afraid. Like here, standing. If you should scream now, if you should holler for help, would it matter?\nYou are so close to the ravine now that in the instant of your scream, in the interval between someone hearing it and running to rescue you, much could happen.\nBlackness could come swiftly, swallowing; and in one titanically freezing moment all would be concluded. Long before dawn, long before police with flashlights might probe the disturbed pathway, long before men with trembling brains could rustle down the pebbles to your help. Even if they were within five hundred yards of you now, and help certainly is, in three seconds a dark tide could rise to take all eight years of life away from you and Death would meet you in the full.\nThe essential impact of life's loneliness crushes your small, beginning to tremble body. Mother is alone, too. She cannot look to the sanctity of marriage, the protection of her family's love, she cannot look to the Constitution of the United States, or the City Police, she cannot look anywhere, in this very instant, but into her heart, and there she will find nothing but uncontrollable repugnance and a will to fear. In this instant it is an individual problem seeking an individual solution. You must accept being alone and work on from there.\nYou swallow hard and cling to your Mother. Oh, Lord, don't let her die, you think. Don't do anything to us. Father will be coming home from lodge-meeting in an hour and if the house is empty. . . ?\nMother advances down the path into the primeval jungle a few paces. Your voice is all made of trembles. \"Mother. Skip's all right. Skip's all right. He's all right. Skip's all right.”\nMother's voice is strained, quiet. \"He always comes through here. I tell him not to, but those darned kids, they come through here anyway. Some night he'll come through and never come out again — ”\nNever come out again. That could mean anything. Tramps. Criminals. Darkness. Accidents. Most of all — Death.\nAlone in the universe.\nThere are a million small towns like this all over the world. Each as dark, as lonely, as removed, as full of shuddering and wonder. The reedy playing of minorkey violins is the small town's music, with no lights but many shadows. Oh the vast swelling loneliness of them. The secret damp ravines of them. Life is a horror living in them at night, when at all sides sanity, marriage, children, happiness, is threatened by an ogre called Death.\nMother raises her voice into the night.\n\"Skip! Skipper!” she calls. \"Skip! Skipper!”\nSuddenly, both of you realize there is something wrong. Something very wrong. You listen intently and realize what it is.\nThe crickets have stopped chirping.\nSilence is complete.\nNever in your life a silence like this one. One so utterly complete. Why should the crickets cease? Why? What reason? They have never stopped ever before. Not ever.\nUnless. Unless —\nSomething is going to happen. It is as if the whole ravine is tensing, bunching its blade muscles, drawing in its power from all around the sleeping countryside for miles and miles. From damp dells, from rolling hills where dogs howl to moons, from all around the great silence is sucked into one tight ball, and you at the center of it. In ten seconds now, something will happen. Something will happen. The crickets are still silent, and the stars so close they almost brush your head a cosmic blow. Swarms of them. The night is still hot.\nGrowing, growing, the silence. Growing, growing, the tenseness. Oh, it is so dark, so far away from everything. Oh, oh, God.\nAnd then, way, way off in the silence:\n\"Okay, Mom. Coming, Mother!”\nAnd again;\n\"Hi, Mom! Coming, Mom!”\nAnd then the quick scuttering of feet running down through the stomach of the ravine as three kids come running, laughing. Your brother, Skipper, and Chuck Redman and Augie Bartz. Running, laughing.\nThe stars suck back up in the sky like the stung antennae of ten million snails.\nThe crickets chirp again.\nThe darkness pulls back, startled, shocked, angry. Pulls back, losing its appetite at being so rudely interrupted as it prepared to feed. The darkness yanks back its odorous wet skirt and the three kids pile out of it, laughing.\n\"Hi, Mom! Hi, Shorts!”\nIt smells like Skipper, all right. Sweat and grass and his oiled leather baseball glove.\n\"Young man, you're going to get a licking,” declares Mother. She puts away her fear instantly. You know she will never tell anybody of it, ever. It will be in her heart though, for all time, as it is in your heart, for all time.\nYou walk home to bed in the late summer night. You are glad Skipper is alive. Very glad. For a moment there you thought —\nFar off in the dim moonlit country, over a viaduct and down a valley, a train goes running along and it whistles like a lost metal nameless thing. You go to bed, shivering, beside your brother, listening to that train whistle, and thinking of a cousin who lived way out in the country where that train is now; a cousin who died of pneumonia late at night years ago. ...\nYou hear footsteps outside the house on the sidewalk, as Mother is turning out the lights. A man clears his throat in a way you recognize.\nMother says, \"That's your father.”\nIt is.\nFrom https://archive.org/details/dandelionwine00brad "},{"id":27,"href":"/site/library/clarke-the-sentinel/","title":"The Sentinel","section":"Library","content":"The next time you see the full moon high in the south, look carefully at its right-hand edge and let your eye travel upward along the curve of the disk. Round about two o’clock you will notice a small, dark oval: anyone with normal eyesight can find it quite easily. It is the great walled plain, one of the finest on the Moon, known as the Mare Crisium-the Sea of Crises. Three hundred miles in diameter, and almost completely surrounded by a ring of magnificent mountains, it had never been explored until we entered it in the late summer of 1996.\nOur expedition was a large one. We had two heavy freighters which had flown our supplies and equipment from the main lunar base in the Mare Serenitatis, five hundred miles away. There were also three small rockets which were intended for short-range transport over regions which our surface vehicles couldn’t cross. Luckily, most of the Mare Crisiurn is very flat. There are none of the great crevasses so common and so dangerous elsewhere, and very few craters or mountains of any size. As far as we could tell, our powerful caterpillar tractors would have no difficulty in taking us wherever we wished to go.\nI was geologist-or selenologist, if you want to be pedantic in charge of. the group exploring the southern region of the Mare. We had crossed a hundred miles of it in a week, skirting the foothills of the mountains along the shore of what was once the ancient sea, some thousand million years before. When life was beginning on Earth, it was already dying here. The waters were retreating down the flanks of those stupendous cliffs, retreating into the empty heart of the Moon. Over the land which we were crossing, the tideless ocean had once been half a mile deep, and now the only trace of moisture was the hoarfrost one could sometimes find in caves which the searing sunlight never penetrated.\nWe had begun our journey early in the slow lunar dawn, and still had almost a week of Earth-time before nightfall. Half a dozen times a day we would leave our vehicle and go outside in the spacesuits to hunt for interesting minerals, or to place markers for the guidance of future travelers. It was an uneventful routine. There is nothing hazardous or even particularly exciting about lunar exploration. We could live comfortably for a month in our pressurized tractors, and if we ran into trouble we could always radio for help and sit tight until one of the spaceships came to our rescue.\nI said just now that there was nothing exciting about lunar exploration, but of course that isn’t true. One could never grow tired of those incredible mountains, so much more rugged than the gentle hills of Earth. We never knew, as we rounded the capes and promontories of that vanished sea, what new splendors would be revealed to us. The whole southern curve of the Mare Crisiurn is a vast delta where a score of rivers once found their way into the ocean, fed perhaps by the torrential rains that must have lashed the mountains in the brief volcanic age when the Moon was young.\nEach of these ancient valleys was an invitation, challenging us to climb into the unknown uplands beyond. But we had a hundred miles still to cover, and could only look longingly at the heights which others must scale.\nWe kept Earth-time aboard the tractor, and precisely at 22.00 hours the final radio message would be sent out to Base and we would close down for the day. Outside, the rocks would still be burning beneath the almost vertical sun, but to us it was night until we awoke again eight hours later. Then one of us would prepare breakfast, there would be a great buzzing of electric razors, and someone would switch on the short-wave radio from Earth. Indeed, when the smell of frying sausages began to fill the cabin, it was sometimes hard to believe that we were not back on our own world – everything was so normal and homely, apart from the feeling of decreased weight and the unnatural slowness with which objects fell.\nIt was my turn to prepare breakfast in the corner of the main cabin that served as a galley. I can remember that moment quite vividly after all these years, for the radio had just played one of my favorite melodies, the old Welsh air, “David of the White, Rock.”\nOur driver was already outside in his space-suit, inspecting our caterpillar treads. My assistant, Louis Garnett, was up forward in the control position, making some belated entries in yesterday’s log.\nAs I stood by the frying pan waiting, like any terrestrial housewife, for the sausages to brown, I let my gaze wander idly over the mountain walls which covered the whole of the southern horizon, marching out of sight to east and west below the curve of the Moon. They seemed only a mile or two from the tractor, but I knew that the nearest was twenty miles away. On the Moon, of course, there is no loss of detail with distance — none of that almost imperceptible haziness which softens and sometimes transfigures all far-off things on Earth.\nThose mountains were ten thousand feet high, and they climbed steeply out of the plain as if ages ago some subterranean eruption had smashed them skyward through the molten crust. The base of even the nearest was hidden from sight by the steeply curving surface of the plain, for the Moon is a very little world, and from where I was standing the horizon was only two miles away.\nI lifted my eyes toward the peaks which no man had ever climbed, the peaks which, before the coming of terrestrial life, had watched the retreating oceans sink sullenly into their graves, taking with them the hope and the morning promise of a world. The sunlight was beating against those ramparts with a glare that hurt the eyes, yet only a little way above them the stars were shining steadily in a sky blacker than a winter midnight on Earth.\nI was turning away when my eye caught a metallic glitter high on the ridge of a great promontory thrusting out into the sea thirty miles to the west. It was a dimensionless point of light, as if a star had been clawed from the sky by one of those cruel peaks, and I imagined that some smooth rock surface was catching the sunlight and heliographing it straight into my eyes. Such things were not uncommon. When the Moon is in her second quarter, observers on Earth can sometimes see the great ranges in the Oceanus Procellarum burning with a blue-white iridescence as the sunlight flashes from their slopes and leaps again from world to world. But I was curious to know what kind of rock could be shining so brightly up there, and I climbed into the observation turret and swung our four inch telescope round to the west.\nI could see just enough to tantalize me. Clear and sharp in the field of vision, the mountain peaks seemed only half a mile away, but whatever was catching the sunlight was still too small to be resolved. Yet it seemed to have an elusive symmetry, and the summit upon which it rested was curiously flat. I stared for a long time at that glittering enigma, straining my eyes into space, until presently a smell of burning from the galley told me that our breakfast sausages had made their quarter-million mile journey in vain. .\nAll that morning we argued our way across the Mare Crisium while the western mountains reared higher in the sky. Even when we were out prospecting in the space-suits, the discussion would continue over the radio. It was absolutely certain, my companions argued, that there had never been any form of intelligent life on the Moon. The only living things that had ever existed there were a few primitive plants and their slightly less degenerate ancestors. I knew that as well as anyone, but there are times when a scientist must not be afraid to make a fool of himself.\n“Listen,” I said at last, “I’m going up there, if only for my own peace of mind. That mountain’s less than twelve thousand feet high -that’s only two thousand under Earth gravity-and I can make the trip in twenty hours at the outside. I’ve always wanted to go up into those hills, anyway, and this gives me an excellent excuse.”\n“If you don’t break your neck,” said Garnett, “you’ll be the laughing-stock of the expedition when we get back to Base. That mountain will probably be called Wilson’s Folly from now on.”\n“I won’t break my neck,” I said firmly. “Who was the first man to climb Pico and Helicon?” “But weren’t you rather younger in those days?” asked Louis gently.\n“That,” I said with great dignity, “is as good a reason as any for going.”\nWe went to bed early that night, after driving the tractor to within half a mile of the promontory. Garnett was coming with me in the morning; he was a good climber, and had often been with me on such exploits before. Our driver was only too glad to be left in charge of the machine.\nAt first sight, those cliffs seemed completely unscalable, but to anyone with a good head for heights, climbing is easy on a world where all weights are only a sixth of their normal value. The real danger in lunar mountaineering lies in overconfidence; a six-hundred-foot drop on the Moon can kill you just as thoroughly as a. hundred-foot fall on Earth.\nWe made our first halt on a wide ledge about four thousand feet above the plain. Climbing had not been very difficult, but my limbs were stiff with the unaccustomed effort, and I was glad of the rest. We could still see the tractor as a tiny metal insect far down at the foot of the cliff, and we reported our progress to the driver before starting on the next ascent.\nInside our suits it was comfortably cool, for the refrigeration units were fighting the fierce sun and carrying away the body-heat of our exertions. We seldom spoke to each other, except to pass climbing instructions and to discuss our best plan of ascent. I do not know what Garnett was thinking, probably that this was the craziest goose-chase he had ever embarked upon. I more than half agreed with him, but the joy of climbing, the knowledge that no man had ever gone this way before and the exhilaration of the steadily widening landscape gave me all the reward I needed.\nI don’t think I was particularly excited when I saw in front of us the wall of rock I had first inspected through the telescope from thirty miles away. It would level off about fifty feet above our heads, and there on the plateau would be the thing that had lured me over these barren wastes. It was, almost certainly, nothing more than a boulder splintered ages ago by a falling meteor, and with its cleavage planes still fresh and bright in this incorruptible, unchanging silence.\nThere were no hand-holds on the rock face, and we had to use a grapnel. My tired arms seemed to gain new strength as I swung the three-pronged metal anchor round my head and sent it sailing Lip toward the stars. The first time it broke loose and came falling slowly back when we pulled the rope. On the third attempt, the prongs gripped firmly and our combined weights could not shift it.\nGarnett looked at me anxiously. I could tell that he wanted to go first, but I smiled back at him through the glass of my helmet and shook my head. Slowly, taking my time, I began the final ascent.\nEven with my space-suit, I weighed only forty pounds here, so I pulled myself up hand over hand without bothering to use my feet. At the rim I paused and waved to my companion, then I scrambled over the edge and stood upright, staring ahead of me.\nYou must understand that until this very moment I had been almost completely convinced that there could be nothing strange or unusual for me to find here. Almost, but not quite; it was that haunting doubt that had driven me forward. Well, it was a doubt no longer, but the haunting had scarcely begun.\nI was standing on a plateau perhaps a hundred feet across. It had once been smooth—too smooth to be natural—but falling meteors had pitted and scored its surface through immeasurable eons. It had been leveled to support a glittering, roughly pyramidal structure, twice as high as a man, that was set in the rock like a gigantic, many-faceted jewel.\nProbably no emotion at all filled my mind in those first few seconds. Then I felt a great lifting of my heart, and a strange, inexpressible joy. For I loved the Moon, and now I knew that the creeping moss of Aristarchus and Eratosthenes was not the only life she had brought forth in her youth. The old, discredited dream of the first explorers was true. There had, after all, been a lunar civilization- and I was the first to find it. That I had come perhaps a hundred million years too late did not distress me; it was enough to have come at all.\nMy mind was beginning to function normally, to analyze and to ask questions. Was this a building, a shrine—or something for which my language had no name? If a building, then why was it erected in so uniquely inaccessible a spot? I wondered if it might be a temple, and I could picture the adepts of some strange priesthood calling on their gods to preserve them as the life of the Moon ebbed with the dying oceans, and calling on their gods in vain.\nI took a dozen steps forward to examine the thing more closely, but some sense of caution kept me from going too near. I knew a little of archaeology, and tried to guess the cultural level of the civilization that must have smoothed this mountain and raised the glittering mirror surfaces that still dazzled my eyes.\nThe Egyptians could have done it, I thought, if their workmen had possessed whatever strange materials these far more ancient architects had used. Because of the thing’s smallness, it did not occur to me that I might be looking at the handiwork of a race more advanced than my own. The idea that the Moon had possessed intelligence at all was still almost too tremendous to grasp, and my pride would not let me take the final, humiliating plunge.\nAnd then I noticed something that set the scalp crawling at the back of my neck—something so trivial and so innocent that many would never have noticed it at all. I have said that the plateau was scarred by meteors; it was also coated inches-deep with the cosmic dust that is always filtering down upon the surface of any world where there are no winds to disturb it. Yet the dust and the meteor scratches ended quite abruptly in a wide circle enclosing the little pyramid, as though an invisible wall was protecting it from the ravages of time and the slow but ceaseless bombardment from space.\nThere was someone shouting in my earphones, and I realized that Garnett had been calling me for some time. I walked unsteadily to the edge of the cliff and signaled him to join me, not trusting myself to speak. Then I went back toward that circle in the dust. I picked up a fragment of splintered rock and tossed it gently toward the shining enigma. If the pebble had vanished at that invisible barrier I should not have been surprised, but it seemed to hit a smooth, hemispherical surface and slide gently to the ground.\nI knew then that I was looking at nothing that could be matched in the antiquity of my own race. This was not a building, but a machine, protecting itself with forces that had challenged Eternity. Those forces, whatever they might be, were still operating, and perhaps I had already come too close. I thought of all the radiations man had trapped and tamed in the past century. For all I knew, I might be as irrevocably doomed as if I had stepped into the deadly, silent aura of an unshielded atomic pile.\nI remember turning then toward Garnett, who had joined me and was now standing motionless at my side. He seemed quite oblivious to me, so I did not disturb him but walked to the edge of the cliff in an effort to marshal my thoughts. There below me lay the Mare Crisium-Sea of Crises, indeed—strange and weird to most men, but reassuringly familiar to me. I lifted my eyes toward the crescent Earth, lying in her cradle of stars, and I wondered what her clouds had covered when these unknown builders had finished their work. Was it the steaming jungle of the Carboniferous, the bleak shoreline over which the first amphibians must crawl to conquer the land—or, earlier still, the long loneliness before the coming of life?\nDo not ask me why I did not guess the truth sooner—the truth, that seems so obvious now. In the first excitement of my discovery, I had assumed without question that this crystalline apparition had been built by some race belonging to the Moon’s remote past, but suddenly, and with overwhelming force, the belief came to me that it was as alien to the Moon as I myself.\nIn twenty years we had found no trace of life but a few degenerate plants. No lunar civilization, whatever its doom, could have left but a single token of its existence.\nI looked at the shining pyramid again, and the more remote it seemed from anything that had to do with the Moon. And suddenly I felt myself shaking with a foolish, hysterical laughter, brought on by excitement and overexertion: for I had imagined that the little pyramid was speaking to me and was saying: “Sorry, I’m a stranger here myself.”\nIt has taken us twenty years to crack that invisible shield and to reach the machine inside those crystal walls. What we could not understand, we broke at last with the savage might of atomic power and now I have seen the fragments of the lovely, glittering thing I found up there on the mountain.\nThey are meaningless. The mechanisms—if indeed they are mechanisms—of the pyramid belong to a technology that lies far beyond our horizon, perhaps to the technology of para-physical forces.\nThe mystery haunts us all the more now that the other planets have been reached and we know that only Earth has ever been the home of intelligent life in our Universe. Nor could any lost civilization of our own world have built that machine, for the thickness of the meteoric dust on the plateau has enabled us to measure its age. It was set there upon its mountain before life had emerged from the seas of Earth.\nWhen our world was half its present age, something from the stars swept through the Solar System, left this token of its passage, and went again upon its way. Until we destroyed it, that machine was still fulfilling the purpose of its builders; and as to that purpose, here is my guess.\nNearly a hundred thousand million stars are turning in the circle of the Milky Way, and long ago other races on the worlds of other suns must have scaled and passed the heights that we have reached. Think of such civilizations, far back in time against the fading afterglow of Creation, masters of a universe so young that life as yet had come only to a handful of worlds. Theirs would have been a loneliness we cannot imagine, the loneliness of gods looking out across infinity and finding none to share their thoughts.\nThey must have searched the star clusters as we have searched the planets. Everywhere there would be worlds, but they would be empty or peopled with crawling, mindless things. Such was our own Earth, the smoke of the great volcanoes still staining the skies, when that first ship of the peoples of the dawn came sliding in from the abyss beyond Pluto. It passed the frozen outer worlds, knowing that life could play no part in their destinies. It came to rest among the inner planets, warming themselves around the fire of the Sun and waiting for their stories to begin.\nThose wanderers must have looked on Earth, circling safely in the narrow zone between fire and ice, and must have guessed that it was the favorite of the Sun’s children. Here, in the distant future, would be intelligence; but there were countless stars before -them still, and they might never come this way again.\nSo they left a sentinel, one of millions they have scattered throughout the Universe, watching over all worlds with the promise of life. It was a beacon that down the ages has been patiently signaling the fact that no one had discovered it.\nPerhaps you understand now why that crystal pyramid was set upon the Moon instead of on the Earth. Its builders were not concerned with races still struggling up from savagery. They would be interested in our civilization only if we proved our fitness to survive -by crossing space and so escaping from the Earth, our cradle. That is the challenge that all intelligent races must meet, sooner or later. It is a double challenge, for it depends in turn upon the conquest of atomic energy and the last choice between life and death.\nOnce we had passed that crisis, it was only a matter of time before we found the pyramid and forced it open. Now its signals have ceased, and those whose duty it is will be turning their minds upon Earth. Perhaps they wish to help our infant civilization. But they must be very, very old, and the old are often insanely jealous of the young.\nI can never look now at the Milky Way without wondering from which of those banked clouds of stars the emissaries are coming. If you will pardon so commonplace a simile, we have set off the fire-alarm and have nothing to do but to wait.\nI do not think we will have to wait for long.\nFrom https://archive.org/details/sentinel0000arth "},{"id":28,"href":"/site/library/clarke-the-star/","title":"The Star","section":"Library","content":"It is three thousand light-years to the Vatican. Once, I believed that space could have no power over faith, just as I believed the heavens declared the glory of God’s handwork. Now I have seen that handiwork, and my faith is sorely troubled. I stare at the crucifix that hangs on the cabin wall above the Mark VI Computer, and for the first time in my life I wonder if it is no more than an empty symbol.\nI have told no one yet, but the truth cannot be concealed. The facts are there for all to read, recorded on the countless miles of magnetic tape and the thousands of photographs we are carrying back to Earth. Other scientists can interpret them as easily as I can, and I am not one who would condone that tampering with the truth which often gave my order a bad name in the olden days.\nThe crew were already sufficiently depressed: I wonder how they will take this ultimate irony. Few of them have any religious faith, yet they will not relish using this final weapon in their campaign against me—that private, good-natured, but fundamentally serious war which lasted all the way from Earth. It amused them to have a Jesuit as chief astrophysicist: Dr. Chandler, for instance, could never get over it. (Why are medical men such notorious atheists?) Sometimes he would meet me on the observation deck, where the lights are always low so that the stars shine with undiminished glory. He would come up to me in the gloom and stand staring out of the great oval port, while the heavens crawled slowly around us as the ship turned over and over with the residual spin we had never bothered to correct.\n“Well, Father,” he would say at last, “it goes on forever and forever, and perhaps Something made it. But how you can believe that Something has a special interest in us and our miserable little world—that just beats me.” Then the argument would start, while the stars and nebulae would swing around us in silent, endless arcs beyond the flawlessly clear plastic of the observation port.\nIt was, I think, the apparent incongruity of my position that cause most amusement among the crew. In vain I pointed to my three papers in the Astrophysical Journal, my five in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. I would remind them that my order has long been famous for its scientific works. We may be few now, but ever since the eighteenth century we have made contributions to astronomy and geophysics out of all proportion to our numbers. Will my report on the Phoenix Nebula end our thousand years of history? It will end, I fear, much more than that.\nI do not know who gave the nebula its name, which seems to me a very bad one. If it contains a prophecy, it is one that cannot be verified for several billion years. Even the word “nebula” is misleading; this is a far smaller object than those stupendous clouds of mist—the stuff of unborn stars—that are scattered throughout the length of the Milky Way. On the cosmic scale, indeed, the Phoenix Nebula is a tiny thing—a tenuous shell of gas surrounding a single star.\nOr what is left of a star. . .\nThe Rubens engraving of Loyola seems to mock me as it hangs there above the spectrophotometer tracings. What would you, Father, have made of this knowledge that has come into my keeping, so far from the little world that was all the Universe you knew? Would your faith have risen to the challenge, as mine has failed to do?\nYou gaze into the distance, Father, but I have traveled a distance beyond any that you could have imagined when you founded our order a thousand years ago. No other survey ship has been so far from Earth: we are at the very frontiers of the explored Universe. We set out to reach the Phoenix Nebula, we succeeded, and we are homeward bound with our burden of knowledge. I wish I could lift that burden from my shoulders, but I call to you in vain across the centuries and the light-years that lie between us.\nOn the book you are holding the words are plain to read. AD MAIOREM DEI GLORIAM, the message runs, but it is a message I can no longer believe. Would you still believe it, if you could see what we have found?\nWe knew, of course, what the Phoenix Nebula was. Every year, in our Galaxy alone, more than a hundred stars explode, blazing for a few hours or days with hundreds of times their normal brilliance until they sink back into death and obscurity. Such are the ordinary novas—the commonplace disasters of the Universe. I have recorded the spectrograms and light curves of dozens since I started working at the Lunar Observatory.\nBut three or four times in every thousand years occurs something beside which even a nova pales into total insignificance.\nWhen a star becomes a supernova, it may for a little while outshine all the massed suns of the Galaxy. The Chinese astronomers watched this happen in A.D. 1054, not knowing what it was they saw. Five centuries later, in 1572, a supernova blazed in Cassiopeia so brilliantly that it was visible in the daylight sky. There have been three more in the thousand years that have passed since then.\nOur mission was to visit the remnants of such a catastrophe, to reconstruct the events that led up to it, and, if possible, to learn its cause. We came slowly in through the concentric shells of gas that had been blasted out six thousand years before, yet were expanding still. They were immensely hot, radiating even now with a fierce violet light, but were far too tenuous to do us any damage. When the star had exploded, its outer layers had been driven upward with such speed that they had escaped completely from its gravitational field. Now they formed a hollow shell large enough to engulf a thousand solar systems, and at its center burned the tiny, fantastic object which the star had now become—a White Dwarf, smaller than earth, yet weighing a million times as much.\nThe glowing gas shells were all around us, banishing the normal night of interstellar space. We were flying into the center of the cosmic bomb that had detonated millennia ago and whose incandescent fragments were still hurtling apart. The immense scale of the explosion, and the fact that the debris already covered a volume of space many millions of miles across, robbed the scene of any visible movement. It would take decades before the unaided eye could detect any motion in these tortured wisps and eddies of gas, yet the sense of turbulent expansion was overwhelming.\nWe had checked our primary drive hours before, and were drifting slowly toward the fierce little star ahead. Once it had been a sun like our own, but it had squandered in a few hours the energy that should have kept it shining for a million years. Now it was a shrunken miser, hoarding its resources as if trying to make amends for its prodigal youth.\nNo one seriously expected to find planets. If there had been any before the explosion, they would have been boiled into puffs of vapor, and their substance lost in the greater wreckage of the star itself. But we made the automatic search, as we always do when approaching an unknown sun, and presently we found a single small world circling the star at an immense distance. It must have been the Pluto of this vanished Solar System, orbiting on the frontiers of the night. Too far from the central sun ever to have known life, its remoteness had saved it from the fate of all its lost companions.\nThe passing fires had seared its rocks and burned away the mantle of frozen gas that must have covered it in the days before the disaster. We landed, and we found the Vault.\nIts builders had made sure that we should. The monolithic marker that stood above the entrance was now a fused stump, but even the first long-range photographs told us that here was the work of intelligence. A little later we detected the continent-wide pattern of radioactivity that had been buried in the rock. Even if the pylon above the Vault had been destroyed, this would have remained, an immovable and all-but eternal beacon calling to the stars. Our ship fell toward this gigantic bull’s eye like an arrow into its target.\nThe pylon must have been a mile high when it was built, but now it looked like a candle that had melted down into a puddle of wax. It took us a week to drill through the fused rock, since we did not have the proper tools for a task like this. We were astronomers, not archaeologists, but we could improvise. Our original purpose was forgotten: this lonely monument, reared with such labor at the greatest possible distance from the doomed sun, could have only one meaning. A civilization that knew it was about to die had made its last bid for immortality.\nIt will take us generations to examine all the treasures that were placed in the Vault. They had plenty of time to prepare, for their sun must have given its first warnings many years before the final detonation. Everything that they wished to preserve, all the fruits of their genius, they brought here to this distant world in the days before the end, hoping that some other race would find it and that they would not be utterly forgotten. Would we have done as well, or would we have been too lost in our own misery to give thought to a future we could never see or share?\nIf only they had had a little more time! They could travel freely enough between the planets of their own sun, but they had not yet learned to cross the interstellar gulfs, and the nearest Solar System was a hundred light-years away. Yet even had they possessed the secret of the Transfinite Drive, no more than a few millions could have been saved. Perhaps it was better thus.\nEven if they had not been so disturbingly human as their sculpture shows, we could not have helped admiring them and grieving for their fate. They left thousands of visual records and the machines for projecting them, together with elaborate pictorial instructions from which it will not be difficult to learn their written language. We have examined many of these records, and brought to life for the first time in six thousand years the warmth and beauty of a civilization that in many ways must have been superior to our own. Perhaps they only showed us the best, and one can hardly blame them. But their worlds were very lovely, and their cities were built with a grace that matches anything of man’s. We have watched them at work and play, and listened to their musical speech sounding across the centuries. One scene is still before my eyes—a group of children on a beach of strange blue sand, playing in the waves as children play on Earth. Curious whiplike trees line the shore, and some very large animal is wading in the shallows, yet attracting no attention at all.\nAnd sinking into the sea, still warm and friendly and life-giving, is the sun that will soon turn traitor and obliterate all this innocent happiness.\nPerhaps if we had not been so far from home and so vulnerable to loneliness, we should not have been so deeply moved. Many of us had seen the ruins of ancient civilizations on other worlds, but they had never affected us so profoundly. This tragedy was unique. It is one thing for a race to fail and die, as nations and cultures have done on Earth. But to be destroyed so completely in the full flower of its achievement, leaving no survivors—how could that be reconciled with the mercy of God?\nMy colleagues have asked me that, and I have given what answers I can. Perhaps you could have done better, Father Loyola, but I have found nothing in the Exercitia Spiritualia that helps me here. They were not an evil people: I do not know what gods they worshiped, if indeed they worshiped any. But I have looked back at them across the centuries, and have watched while the loveliness they used their last strength to preserve was brought forth again into the light of their shrunken sun. They could have taught us much: why were they destroyed?\nI know the answers that my colleagues will give when they get back to Earth. They will say that the Universe has no purpose and no plan, that since a hundred suns explode every year in our Galaxy, at this very moment some race is dying in the depths of space. Whether that race has done good or evil during its lifetime will make no difference in the end: there is no divine justice, for there is no God.\nYet, of course, what we have seen proves nothing of the sort. Anyone who argues thus is being swayed by emotion, not logic. God has no need to justify His actions to man. He who built the Universe can destroy it when He chooses. It is arrogance—it is perilously near blasphemy—for us to say what He may or may not do.\nThis I could have accepted, hard though it is to look upon whole worlds and peoples thrown into the furnace. But there comes a point when even the deepest faith must falter, and now, as I look at the calculations lying before me, I have reached that point at last.\nWe could not tell, before we reached the nebula, how long ago the explosion took place. Now, from the astronomical evidence and the record in the rocks of that one surviving planet, I have been able to date it very exactly. I know in what year the light of this colossal conflagration reached the Earth. I know how brilliantly the supernova whose corpse now dwindles behind our speeding ship once shone in terrestrial skies. I know how it must have blazed low in the east before sunrise, like a beacon in that oriental dawn.\nThere can be no reasonable doubt: the ancient mystery is solved at last. Yet, oh God, there were so many stars you could have used. What was the need to give these people to the fire, that the symbol of their passing might shine above Bethlehem?

Seven-nine, breakfast time, seven-nine!\nIn the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing sigh and ejected from its warm interior eight pieces of perfectly browned toast, eight eggs sunnyside up, sixteen slices of bacon, two coffees, and two cool glasses of milk.\n\"Today is August 4, 2026,\" said a second voice from the kitchen ceiling, \"in the city of Allendale, California.\" It repeated the date three times for memory's sake. \"Today is Mr. Featherstone's birthday.

But no doors slammed, no carpets took the soft tread of rubber heels. It was raining outside. The weather box on the fron door sang quietly: \"Rain, rain, go away; rubbers, raincoats for today...\" And the rain tapped on the empty house, echoing.\nOutside, the garage chimed and lifted its door to reveal the waiting car. After a long wait the door swung down again.\nAt eight-thirty the eggs were shriveled and the toast was like stone. An aluminum wedge scraped them down a metal throat which digested and flushed them away to the distant sea. The dirty dishes were dropped into a hot washer and emerged twinkling dry.\nNine-fifteen, sang the clock, time to clean. Out of warrens in the wall, tiny robot mice darted. The rooms were a crawl with the small cleaning animals, all rubber and metal. They thudded against chairs, whirling their mustached runners, kneading the rug nap, sucking gently at hidden dust. Then, like mysterious invaders, they popped into their burrows. Their pink electric eye faded. The house was clean.\nTen o'clock. The sun came out from behind the rain. The house stood alone in a city of rubble and ashes. This was the one house left standing. At night the ruined city gave of a radioactive glow which could be seen for miles.\nTen-fifteen. The garden sprinklers whirled up in golden founts, filling the soft morning air with scatterings of brightness. The water pelted windowpanes, running down the charred west side where the house had been burned evenly free of its white paint. The entire west face of the house was black, save for five places. Here the silhouette in paint of a man mowing a lawn. Here, as in a photograph, a woman bent to pick flowers. Still farther over, their images burned on wood in one titantic instant, a small boy, hands flung into the air; higher up, the image of thrown ball, and opposite him a girl, hand raised to catch a ball which never came down. The five spots of paint- the man, the woman, the children, the ball - remained. The rest was a thin charcoaled layer. The gentle sprinkler rain filled the garden with falling light.\nUntil this day, how well the house had kept its peace. How carefully it had inquired, 'Who goes there? What's the password?\" and, getting no answer from lonely foxes and whining cats, it had shut up its windows and drawn shades in an old-maidenly preoccupation with self-protection which bordered on a mechanical paranoia.\nIt quivered at each sound, the house did. If a sparrow brushed a window, the shade snapped up. The bird, startled, flew off! No, not even a bird must touch the house!\nThe house was an altar with ten thousand attendants, big, small, servicing, attending, in choirs. But the gods had gone away, and the ritual of the religion continued senselessly, uselessly.\nTwelve noon.\nA dog whined, shivering, on the front porch.\nThe front door recognized the dog voice and opened. The dog, once large and fleshy, but now gone to bone and covered with sores, moved in and through the house, tracking mud. Behind it whirred angry mice, angry at having to pick up mud, angry at inconvenience.\nFor not a leaf fragment blew under the door but what the wall panels flipped open and the copper scrap rats flashed swiftly out. The offending dust, hair, or paper, seized in miniature steel jaws, was raced back to the burrows. There, down tubes which fed into the cellar, it was dropped like evil Baal in a dark corner.\nThe dog ran upstairs, hysterically yelping to each door, at last realizing, as the house realized, that only silence was here. It sniffed the air and scratched the kitchen door. Behind the door, the stove was making pancakes which filled the house with a rich odor and the scent of maple syrup. The dog frothed at the mouth, lying at the door, sniffing, its eyes turned to fire. It ran wildly in circles, biting at its tail, spun in a frenzy, and died. It lay in the parlor for an hour.\nTwo 'clock, sang a voice.\nDelicately sensing decay at last, the regiments of mice hummed out as softly as blown gray leaves in an electrical wind.\nTwo-fifteen.\nThe dog was gone.\nIn the cellar, the incinerator glowed suddenly and a whirl of sparks leaped up the chimney.\nTwo thirty-five.\nBridge tables sprouted from patio walls. Playing cards fluttered onto pads in a shower of pips. Martinis manifested on an oaken bench with egg salad sandwiches. Music played.\nBut the tables were silent and the cards untouched.\nAt four o'clock the tables folded like great butterflies back through the paneled walls.\nFour-thirty.\nThe nursery walls glowed.\nAnimals took shape: yellow giraffes, blue lions, pink antelopes, lilac panthers cavorting in crystal substance. The walls were glass. They looked out upon color and fantasy. Hidden films clocked though the well-oiled sprockets, and the walls lived. The nursery floor was woven to resemble a crisp cereal meadow. Over this ran aluminum roaches and iron crickets, and in the hot still air butterflies of delicate red tissue wavered among the sharp aroma of animal spoors! There was the sound like a great matted yellow hive of bees within a dark bellows, the lazy bumble of a purring lion. And there was the patter of okapi feet and the murmur of a fresh jungle rain, like other hoofs falling upon the summer-starched grass. Now the walls dissolved into distances of parched weed, mile on mile, and warm endless sky. The animals drew away into thorn brakes and water holes. It was the children's hour.\nFive o'clock. The bath filled with clear hot water.\nSix, seven, eight o'clock. The dinner dishes manipulated like magic tricks, and in the study a click. In the metal stand opposite the hearth where a fire now blazed up warmly, a cigar popped out, half an inch of soft gray ash on it, smoking, waiting.\nNine o'clock. The beds warmed their hidden circuits, for nights were cool here.\nNine-five. A voice spoke from the study ceiling: \"Mrs. McClellan, which poem would you like this evening?\"\nThe house was silent.\nThe voice said at last, \"Since you express no preference, I shall select a poem at random.\" Quiet music rose to back the voice. \"Sara Teasdale. As I recall, your favorite...\n\"There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,\nAnd swallows circling with their shimmering sound;\nAnd frogs in the pools singing at night,\nAnd wild plum trees in tremulous white;\nRobins will wear their feathery fire, Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;\nAnd not one will know of the war, not one\nWill care at last when it is done.\nNot one would mind, neither bird nor tree,\nIf mankind perished utterly;\nAnd Spring herself, when she woke at dawn\nWould scarcely know that we were gone.\"\nThe fire burned on the stone hearth and the cigar fell away into a mound of quiet ash on its tray. The empty chairs faced each other between the silent walls, and the music played.\nAt ten o'clock the house began to die.\nThe wind blew. A falling tree bough crashed through the kitchen window. Cleaning solvent, bottled, shattered over the stove. The room was ablaze in an instant!\n\"Fire!\" screamed a voice. The house lights flashed, water pumps shot water from the ceilings. But the solvent spread on the linoleum, licking, eating, under the kitchen door, while the voices took it up in chorus: \"Fire, fire, fire!\"\nThe house tried to save itself. Doors sprang tightly shut, but the windows were broken by the heat and the wind blew and sucked upon the fire.\nThe house gave ground as the fire in ten billion angry sparks moved with flaming ease from room to room and then up the stairs. While scurrying water rats squeaked from the walls, pistoled their water, and ran for more. And the wall sprays let down showers of mechanical rain.\nBut too late. Somewhere, sighing, a pump shrugged to a stop. The quenching rain ceased. The reserve water supply which filled the baths and washed the dishes for many quiet days was gone.\nThe fire crackled up the stairs. It fed upon Picassos and Matisses in the upper halls, like delicacies, baking off the oily flesh, tenderly crisping the canvases into black shavings.\nNow the fire lay in beds, stood in windows, changed the colors of drapes!\nAnd then, reinforcements.\nFrom attic trapdoors, blind robot faces peered down with faucet mouths gushing green chemical.\nThe fire backed off, as even an elephant must at the sight of a dead snake. Now there were twenty snakes whipping over the floor, killing the fire with a clear cold venom of green froth.\nBut the fire was clever. It had sent flames outside the house, up through the attic to the pumps there. An explosion! The attic brain which directed the pumps was shattered into bronzeshrapnel on the beams.\nThe fire rushed back into every closet and felt of the clothes that hung there.\nThe house shuddered, oak bone on bone, its bared skeleton cringing from the heat, its wire, its nerves revealed as if a surgeon had torn the skin off to let the red veins and capillaries quiver in the scalded air. Help, help! Fire! Run, run! Heat snapped mirrors like the first brittle winter ice. And the voices wailed Fire, fire, run, run, like a tragic nursery rhyme, a dozen voices, high, low, like children dying in a forest, alone, alone. And the voices fading as the wires popped their sheathings like hot chestnuts. One, two, three, four, five voices died.\nIn the nursery the jungle burned. Blue lions roared, purple giraffes bounded off. The panthers ran in circles, changing color, and ten million animals, running before the fire, vanished off toward a distant steaming river...\nTen more voices died. In the last instant under the fire avalanche, other choruses, oblivious, could be heard announcing the time, playing music, cutting the lawn by remote-control mower, or setting an umbrella frantically out and in the slamming and opening front door, a thousand things happening, like a clock shop when each clock strikes the hour insanely before or after the other, a scene of maniac confusion, yet unity; singing, screaming, a few last cleaning mice darting bravely out to carry the horrid ashes away! And one voice, with sublime disregard for the situation, read poetry aloud all in the fiery study, until all the film spools burned, until all the wires withered and the circuits cracked.\nThe fire burst the house and let it slam flat down, puffing out skirts of spark and smoke.\nIn the kitchen, an instant before the rain of fire and timber, the stove could be seen making breakfasts at a psychopathic rate, ten dozen eggs, six loaves of toast, twenty dozen bacon strips, which , eaten by fire, started the stove working again,hysterically hissing!\nThe crash. The attic smashing into the kitchen and parlor. The parlor into cellar, cellar into sub-cellar. Deep freeze, armchair, film tapes, circuits, beds, and all like skeletons thrown in a cluttered mound deep under.\nSmoke and silence. A great quantity of smoke.\nDawn showed faintly in the east. Among the ruins, one wall stood alone. Within the wall, a last voice said, over and over again and again, even as the sun rose to shine upon the heaper rubble and steam:\n\"Today is August 5, 2026, today is August 5, 2026, today is...\"\nThis version is from \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nOriginal version is from Collier's Weekly, May 6, 1950: https://unz.com/print/Colliers-1950may06-00034/ (Backed up here) "},{"id":30,"href":"/site/docs/solar-system/70-saturn/titan/","title":"Titan","section":"Saturn","content":" Wikipedia # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)\nMaps # Quadrangles # Titan\u0026rsquo;s quadrangles haven\u0026rsquo;t been defined at the time of writing. We can assume that they should be named \u0026ldquo;St\u0026rdquo; can be inferred from the other jovian and saturnian moons such as Europa (Je), Ganymede (Jg), Enceladus (Se)\u0026hellip; So Titan should be St.\nRegarding the quadrangles definition, I overlapped the traditional division into 15 quadrangles of the Jovian moons (and other moons/small planets) found here: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19930001644/downloads/19930001644.pdf ( backup ) with a map of the main albedo features known to date.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20713\nThis map of Titan shows the names of many (but not all) features on the Saturnian moon that have been approved by the International Astronomical Union. The map shows Cassini imaging coverage of Titan as of June 2015 (previously published as PIA19658).\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19657\nThe northern and southern hemispheres of Titan are seen in these polar stereographic maps, assembled in 2015 using the best-available images of the giant Saturnian moon from NASA\u0026rsquo;s Cassini mission. The images were taken by Cassini\u0026rsquo;s imaging cameras using a spectral filter centered at 938 nanometers, allowing researchers to examine variations in albedo (or inherent brightness) across the surface of Titan. These maps utilize imaging data collected through Cassini\u0026rsquo;s flyby on April 7, 2014, known as \u0026ldquo;T100.\u0026rdquo;\nTitan\u0026rsquo;s north pole was not well illuminated early in Cassini\u0026rsquo;s mission, because it was winter in the northern hemisphere when the spacecraft arrived at Saturn. Cassini has been better able to observe northern latitudes in more recent years due to seasonal changes in solar illumination. Compared to the previous version of Cassini\u0026rsquo;s north polar map (see PIA11146), this map provides much more detail and fills in a large area of missing data. The imaging data in these maps complement Cassini synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mapping of Titan\u0026rsquo;s north pole (see PIA17655).\nThe uniform gray area in the northern hemisphere indicates a gap in the imaging coverage of Titan\u0026rsquo;s surface, to date. The missing data will be imaged by Cassini during flybys on December 15, 2016 and March 5, 2017.\nLakes are also seen in the southern hemisphere map, but they are much less common than in the north polar region. Only a lakes have been confirmed in the south. The dark, footprint-shaped feature at 180 degrees west is Ontario Lacus; a smaller lake named Crveno Lacus can be seen as a very dark spot just above Ontario. The dark-albedo area seen at the top of the southern hemisphere map (at 0 degrees west) is an area called Mezzoramia.\nEach map is centered on one of the poles, and surface coverage extends southward to 60 degrees latitude. Grid lines indicate latitude in 10-degree increments and longitude in 30-degree increments. The scale in the full-size versions of these maps is 4,600 feet (1,400 meters) per pixel. The mean radius of Titan used for projection of these maps is 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers).\nSo for example the North Pole is clearly in St-01, while features like Adiri is split between St-09 and St-08. Regaridng the names, St-08\u0026rsquo;s main feature is the dark patch Belet, St-09 contains primarily Shangri-La, so the names could be picked easily. However, St-01 contains three \u0026ldquo;seas\u0026rdquo;: Kraken, Ligeia and Punga. Kraken is the biggest, but its center is technically outside of the St-01 quadrangle (located at 68°N, while St-01 ends at 66°N), so the next reasonable choice is Ligeia.\nSummary:\nSt-01 Ligeia: 180-65°N, 0-360°E\nSt-08 Belet: 22°N-22°S, 288-216°E\nSt-09 Shangri-la: 22°N-22°S, 216-144°E\nSky # Brightness # The high Titan atmosphere is opaque to visible light. Therefore, the sky of Titan is constantly covered by what looks like a cover of thick clouds and the brightness, even during daytime, is quite similar to what one would see during a storm or indoors.\nArticle: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aae519 ( Backup )\n\u0026ldquo;Sky brightness and viewing conditions are expected to be quite different from Earth and Mars due to Titan\u0026rsquo;s farther distance from the Sun ( 10 AU) and complex haze layers in its atmosphere. The sky brightness model videos show what a typical sunny day may look like standing on the surface of Titan based on radiative transfer models.\nFor astronauts who see with visible light, the daytime sky has a distinctly dark orange color and appears uniform in all directions due to significant Mie scattering from the many high-altitude haze layers. The daytime sky is calculated to be 100-1000 times dimmer than an afternoon on Earth, which is similar to the viewing conditions of a thick smog or dense fire smoke. The sunsets on Titan are expected to be \u0026ldquo;underwhelming events\u0026rdquo;, where the Sun disappears about half-way up in the sky (50° above the horizon) with no distinct change in color. After that, the sky will slowly darken until it reaches night. However, the surface is expected to remain as bright as the full Moon up to 1 Earth-day after sunset.\nFor reference on the luminosity levels: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6656201/\nOutdoor light levels were much higher (11,080\u0026ndash;18,176 lux) than indoors (112\u0026ndash;156 lux). The higher lux levels protective of myopia (\u0026gt;1000 lux) were measured at the tree shade (5556\u0026ndash;7876 lux) and with hat (4112\u0026ndash;8156 lux). [\u0026hellip;] illuminance levels reaching 130,000 lux on a clear day to 15,000 lux under shaded or cloudy conditions.\nSaturn\u0026rsquo;s visibility # From \u0026ldquo;Saturn\u0026rsquo;s Moon Titan: From 4. 5 Billion Years Ago to the Present - an Insight Into the Workings and Exploration of the Most Earth-Like World in the Outer Solar System\u0026rdquo;, Ralph Lorenz https://books.google.pt/books?id=xyNRygEACAAJ\u0026redir_esc=y\nIn visible light, Saturn will make the sky on Titan\u0026rsquo;s Saturn-facing side appear slightly brighter, similar to an overcast night with a full moon on Earth. Saturn\u0026rsquo;s rings are hidden from view owing to the alignment of Titan\u0026rsquo;s orbital plane and the plane of the rings. Saturn is expected to show phases, akin to the phases of Venus on Earth, that partially illuminate the surface of Titan at night, except for eclipses.\nFrom NASA\u0026rsquo;s simulator https://space.jpl.nasa.gov/, 90° aperture:\nMagnetosphere # Titan spends 95% of its time within Saturn\u0026rsquo;s magnetosphere, which may help shield it from the solar wind.\nTitan orbits Saturn once every 15 days and 22 hours.\nSo 5% should be the time spent exposed to solar wind, which amounts to (0.05 * 16 * 24) = 19h every two weeks.\nI find everywhere mentions to the fact that Titan\u0026rsquo;s surface is not strongly radioactive, but I can\u0026rsquo;t find references or explanations, so I can\u0026rsquo;t say whether it\u0026rsquo;s lack of data or not, whether it\u0026rsquo;s due to its atmosphere or Saturn\u0026rsquo;s magnetosphere or whatnot. :(\nAtmosphere # Color # External layers are dark, UV blue, internal layers are yellow-orange due to the presence of tolines.\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmgill/50320802233/in/photostream/\nProcessed using calibrated red, green, and blue filtered images of Titan taken by Cassini on November 19 2007.

Gill\nWeather and Climate # Titan\u0026rsquo;s surface temperature is about 94 K (-179.2C). At this temperature, water ice has an extremely low vapor pressure, so the little water vapor present appears limited to the stratosphere. Titan receives about 1% as much sunlight as Earth. Before sunlight reaches the surface, about 90% has been absorbed by the thick atmosphere, leaving only 0.1% of the amount of light Earth receives.\nThere seem to be clearly a complex weather system on Titan, very similar to Earth\u0026rsquo;s, with a \u0026ldquo;methane cycle\u0026rdquo; similar to the water cycle on Earth. However, is often unclear what pictures are taken in visible light and what in infrared, because due to Titan\u0026rsquo;s haze opacity to visible light, most images default to infrared without telling.\nClouds # https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA18420\nThis animated sequence of Cassini images shows methane clouds moving above the large methane sea on Saturn\u0026rsquo;s moon Titan known as Ligeia Mare. The spacecraft captured the views between July 20 and July 22, 2014, as it departed Titan following a flyby. Cassini tracked the system of clouds as it developed and dissipated over Ligeia Mare during this two-day period. Measurements of the cloud motions indicate wind speeds of around 7 to 10 miles per hour (3 to 4.5 meters per second).\nThe timing between exposures in the sequence varies. In particular, there is a 17.5-hour jump between the second and third frames. Most other frames are separated by one to two hours. A separate view, PIA18421, shows the location of these clouds relative to features in Titan\u0026rsquo;s north polar region.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA18421\nAs NASA\u0026rsquo;s Cassini spacecraft sped away from Titan following a relatively close flyby, its cameras monitored the moon\u0026rsquo;s northern polar region, capturing signs of renewed cloud activity.\nCassini scientists noted a decrease in clouds everywhere on Titan after a large storm in 2010, and expected clouds to return sooner, based on computer models of Titan\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere. Continued monitoring should help them determine if the clouds\u0026rsquo; appearance signals the beginning of summer weather patterns, or if it is an isolated occurrence.\nA streak of methane clouds is seen here, near center, over the large methane sea known as Ligeia Mare. A movie sequence, PIA18420, shows these clouds in motion over a two-day period.\nSand storms # Article: Observational evidence for active dust storms on Titan at equinox, S. Rodriguez et al, 2018 ( here )\nSurface # The only close-up surface image of Titan, from the Huygens lander (real color for what I know).\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07232\nThis image was returned yesterday, January 14, 2005, by the European Space Agency\u0026rsquo;s Huygens probe during its successful descent to land on Titan. This is the colored view, following processing to add reflection spectra data, and gives a better indication of the actual color of the surface. Initially thought to be rocks or ice blocks, they are more pebble-sized. The two rock-like objects just below the middle of the image are about 15 centimeters (about 6 inches) (left) and 4 centimeters (about 1.5 inches) (center) across respectively, at a distance of about 85 centimeters (about 33 inches) from Huygens. The surface is darker than originally expected, consisting of a mixture of water and hydrocarbon ice. There is also evidence of erosion at the base of these objects, indicating possible fluvial activity.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08119\nThis poster shows a set of images acquired by the European Space Agency\u0026rsquo;s Huygens probe descent imager/spectral radiometer, in the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west), at five different altitudes above Titan\u0026rsquo;s surface. The images were taken on Jan. 14, 2005.\nLakes # https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20021\nThese images from the Radar instrument aboard NASA\u0026rsquo;s Cassini spacecraft show the evolution of a transient feature in the large hydrocarbon sea named Ligeia Mare on Saturn\u0026rsquo;s moon Titan. Analysis by Cassini scientists indicates that the bright features, informally known as the \u0026quot;magic island,\u0026quot; are a phenomenon that changes over time. They conclude that the brightening is due to either waves, solids at or beneath the surface or bubbles, with waves thought to be the most likely explanation. They think tides, sea level and seafloor changes are unlikely to be responsible for the brightening.\nThe images in the column at left show the same region of Ligeia Mare as seen by Cassini\u0026rsquo;s radar during flybys in (from top to bottom) 2007, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The bottom image was acquired by Cassini on Jan. 11, 2015, and adds another snapshot in time as Cassini continues to monitor the ephemeral feature (previously highlighted in PIA18430). The feature is apparent in the images from 2013 and 2014, but it is not present in other images of the region. assini has observed similar transient features elsewhere in Ligeia Mare, and also in Kraken Mare (see PIA19047). These features are the first instances of active processes in Titan\u0026rsquo;s lakes and seas to be confirmed by multiple detections. Their changing nature demonstrates that Titan\u0026rsquo;s seas are not stagnant, but rather, dynamic environments.\nThe Cassini radar team plans to re-observe this particular region of Ligeia Mare one more time during Cassini\u0026rsquo;s final close flyby of Titan in April 2017. The results may further illuminate the phenomenon responsible for the appearance of the transient features. The large image panel shows Ligeia Mare in its entirety. Ligeia is Titan\u0026rsquo;s second-largest liquid hydrocarbon sea, and has a total area of about 50,000 square miles (130,000 square kilometers), making it 50 percent larger than Lake Superior on Earth. This panel is a mosaic of five synthetic aperture radar images acquired by Cassini between 2007 and 2014. It shows a region approximately 330 by 305 miles (530 by 490 kilometers) in area.\n[\u0026hellip;] The images have been colorized and processed for aesthetic appeal.\n"},{"id":31,"href":"/site/library/dick-we-can-remember-for-you-wholesale/","title":"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale","section":"Library","content":"HE AWOKE—and wanted Mars. The valleys, he thought. What would it be like to trudge among them? Great and greater yet: the dream grew as he became fully conscious, the dream and the yearning. He could almost feel the enveloping presence of the other world, which only Government agents and high officials had seen. A clerk like himself? Not likely. \"Are you getting up or not?\" his wife Kirsten asked drowsily, with her usual hint of fierce crossness. \"If you are, push the hot coffee button on the darn stove.\" \"Okay,\" Douglas Quail said, and made his way barefoot from the bedroom of their conapt to the kitchen. There; having dutifully pressed the hot coffee button, he seated himself at the kitchen table, brought out a yellow, small tin of fine Dean Swift snuff. He inhaled briskly, and the Beau Nash mixture stung his nose, burned the roof of his mouth. But still he inhaled; it woke him up and allowed his dreams, his nocturnal desires and random wishes, to condense into a semblance of rationality. I will go, he said to himself. Before I die I'll see Mars. It was, of course, impossible, and he knew this even as he dreamed. But the daylight, the mundane noise of his wife now brushing her hair before the bedroom mirror—everything conspired to remind him of what he was. A miserable little salaried employee, he said to himself with bitterness. Kirsten reminded him of this at least once a day and he did not blame her; it was a wife's job to bring her husband down to Earth. Down to Earth, he thought, and laughed. The figure of speech in this was literally apt. \"What are you sniggering about?\" his wife asked as she swept into the kitchen, her long busy-pink robe wagging after her. \"A dream, I bet. You're always full of them.\" \"Yes,\" he said, and gazed out the kitchen window at the hover-cars and traffic runnels, and all the little energetic people hurrying to work. In a little while he would be among them. As always. \"I'll bet it had to do with some woman,\" Kirsten said witheringly. \"No,\" he said. \"A god. The god of war. He has wonderful craters with every kind of plant-life growing deep down in them.\" \"Listen.\" Kirsten crouched down beside him and spoke earnestly, the harsh quality momentarily gone from her voice. \"The bottom of the ocean—our ocean is much more, an infinity of times more beautiful. You know that; everyone knows that. Rent an artificial gill-outfit for both of us, take a week off from work, and we can descend and live down there at one of those year-round aquatic resorts. And in addition—\" She broke off. \"You're not listening. You should be. Here is something a lot better than that compulsion, that obsession you have about Mars, and you don't even listen!\" Her voice rose piercingly. \"God in heaven, you're doomed, Doug! What's going to become of you?\" \"I'm going to work,\" he said, rising to his feet, his breakfast forgotten. \"That's what's going to become of me.\" She eyed him. \"You're getting worse. More fanatical every day. Where's it going to lead?\" \"To Mars,\" he said, and opened the door to the closet to get down a fresh shirt to wear to work. Having descended from the taxi Douglas Quail slowly walked across three densely-populated foot runnels and to the modern, attractively inviting doorway. There he halted, impeding mid-morning traffic, and with caution read the shifting-color neon sign. He had, in the past, scrutinized this sign before... but never had he come so close. This was very different; what he did now was something else. Something which sooner or later had to happen.\nREKAL, INCORPORATED.\nWas this the answer? After all, an illusion, no matter how convincing, remained nothing more than an illusion. At least objectively. But subjectively—quite the opposite entirely. And anyhow he had an appointment. Within the next five minutes. Taking a deep breath of mildly smog-infested Chicago air, he walked through the dazzling polychromatic shimmer of the doorway and up to the receptionist's counter. The nicely-articulated blonde at the counter, bare-bosomed and tidy, said pleasantly, \"Good morning, Mr. Quail.\" \"Yes,\" he said. \"I'm here to see about a Rekal course. As I guess you know.\" \"Not 'rekal' but recall,\" the receptionist corrected him. She picked up the receiver of the vidphone by her smooth elbow and said into it, \"Mr. Douglas Quail is here, Mr. McClane. May he come inside, now? Or is it too soon?\" \"Giz wetwa wum-wum wamp,\" the phone mumbled. \"Yes, Mr. Quail,\" she said. \"You may go in; Mr. McClane is expecting you.\" As he started off uncertainly she called after him, \"Room D, Mr. Quail. To your right.\" After a frustrating but brief moment of being lost he found the proper room. The door hung open and inside, at a big genuine walnut desk, sat a genial-looking man, middle-aged, wearing the latest Martian frog-pelt gray suit; his attire alone would have told Quail that he had come to the right person. \"Sit down, Douglas,\" McClane said, waving his plump hand toward a chair which faced the desk. \"So you want to have gone to Mars. Very good.\" Quail seated himself, feeling tense. \"I'm not so sure this is worth the fee,\" he said. \"It costs a lot and as far as I can see I really get nothing.\" Costs almost as much as going, he thought. \"You get tangible proof of your trip,\" McClane disagreed emphatically. \"All the proof you'll need. Here; I'll show you.\" He dug within a drawer of his impressive desk. \"Ticket stub.\" Reaching into a manila folder, he produced a small square of embossed cardboard. \"It proves you went—and returned. Postcards.\" He laid out four franked picture 3-D full-color postcards in a neatly-arranged row on the desk for Quail to see. \"Film. Shots you took of local sights on Mars with a rented moving camera.\" To Quail he displayed those, too. \"Plus the names of people you met, two hundred poscreds worth of souvenirs, which will arrive—from Mars—within the following month. And passport, certificates listing the shots you received. And more.\" He glanced up keenly at Quail. \"You'll know you went, all right,\" he said. \"You won't remember us, won't remember me or ever having been here. It'll be a real trip in your mind; we guarantee that. A full two weeks of recall; every last piddling detail. Remember this: if at any time you doubt that you really took an extensive trip to Mars you can return here and get a full refund. You see?\" \"But I didn't go,\" Quail said. \"I won't have gone, no matter what proofs you provide me with.\" He took a deep, unsteady breath. \"And I never was a secret agent with Interplan.\" It seemed impossible to him that Rekal, Incorporated's extra-factual memory implant would do its job—despite what he had heard people say. \"Mr. Quail,\" McClane said patiently. \"As you explained in your letter to us, you have no chance, no possibility in the slightest, of ever actually getting to Mars; you can't afford it, and what is much more important, you could never qualify as an undercover agent for Interplan or anybody else. This is the only way you can achieve your, ahem, life-long dream; am I not correct, sir? You can't be this; you can't actually do this.\" He chuckled. \"But you can have been and have done. We see to that. And our fee is reasonable; no hidden charges.\" He smiled encouragingly. \"Is an extra-factual memory that convincing?\" Quail asked. \"More than the real thing, sir. Had you really gone to Mars as an Interplan agent, you would by now have forgotten a great deal; our analysis of true-mem systems—authentic recollections of major events in a person's life—shows that a variety of details are very quickly lost to the person. Forever. Part of the package we offer you is such deep implantation of recall that nothing is forgotten. The packet which is fed to you while you're comatose is the creation of trained experts, men who have spent years on Mars; in every case we verify details down to the last iota. And you've picked a rather easy extra-factual system; had you picked Pluto or wanted to be Emperor of the Inner Planet Alliance we'd have much more difficulty... and the charges would be considerably greater.\" Reaching into his coat for his wallet, Quail said, \"Okay. It's been my life-long ambition and so I see I'll never really do it. So I guess I'll have to settle for this.\" \"Don't think of it that way,\" McClane said severely. \"You're not accepting second-best. The actual memory, with all its vagueness, omissions and ellipses, not to say distortions—that's second-best.\" He accepted the money and pressed a button on his desk. \"All right, Mr. Quail,\" he said, as the door of his office opened and two burly men swiftly entered. \"You're on your way to Mars as a secret agent.\" He rose, came over to shake Quail's nervous, moist hand. \"Or rather, you have been on your way. This afternoon at four-thirty you will, um, arrive back here on Terra; a cab will leave you off at your conapt and as I say you will never remember seeing me or coming here; you won't, in fact, even remember having heard of our existence.\" His mouth dry with nervousness, Quail followed the two technicians from the office; what happened next depended on them. Will I actually believe I've been on Mars? he wondered. That I managed to fulfill my lifetime ambition? He had a strange, lingering intuition that something would go wrong. But just what—he did not know. He would have to wait and find out.\nThe intercom on McClane's desk, which connected him with the work area of the firm, buzzed and a voice said, \"Mr. Quail is under sedation now, sir. Do you want to supervise this one, or shall we go ahead?\" \"It's routine,\" McClane observed. \"You may go ahead, Lowe; I don't think you'll run into any trouble.\" Programming an artificial memory of a trip to another planet—with or without the added fillip of being a secret agent—showed up on the firm's work-schedule with monotonous regularity. In one month, he calculated wryly, we must do twenty of these... ersatz interplanetary travel has become our bread and butter. \"Whatever you say, Mr. McClane,\" Lowe's voice came, and thereupon the intercom shut off. Going to the vault section in the chamber behind his office, McClane searched about for a Three packet—trip to Mars—and a Sixty-two packet: secret Interplan spy. Finding the two packets, he returned with them to his desk, seated himself comfortably, poured out the contents—merchandise which would be planted in Quail's conapt while the lab technicians busied themselves installing false memory. A one-poscred sneaky-pete side arm, McClane reflected; that's the largest item. Sets us back financially the most. Then a pellet-sized transmitter, which could be swallowed if the agent were caught. Code book that astonishingly resembled the real thing... the firm's models were highly accurate: based, whenever possible, on actual U.S. military issue. Odd bits which made no intrinsic sense but which would be woven into the warp and woof of Quail's imaginary trip, would coincide with his memory: half an ancient silver fifty cent piece, several quotations from John Donne's sermons written incorrectly, each on a separate piece of transparent tissue-thin paper, several match folders from bars on Mars, a stainless steel spoon engraved PROPERTY OF DOME-MARS NATIONAL KIBBUZIM, a wire tapping coil which— The intercom buzzed. \"Mr. McClane, I'm sorry to bother you but something rather ominous has come up. Maybe it would be better if you were in here after all. Quail is already under sedation; he reacted well to the narkidrine; he's completely unconscious and receptive. But—\" \"I'll be in.\" Sensing trouble, McClane left his office; a moment later he emerged in the work area. On a hygienic bed lay Douglas Quail, breathing slowly and regularly, his eyes virtually shut; he seemed dimly—but only dimly—aware of the two technicians and now McClane himself. \"There's no space to insert false memory-patterns?\" McClane felt irritation. \"Merely drop out two work weeks; he's employed as a clerk at the West Coast Emigration Bureau, which is a government agency, so he undoubtedly has or had two weeks' vacation within the last year. That ought to do it.\" Petty details annoyed him. And always would. \"Our problem,\" Lowe said sharply, \"is something quite different.\" He bent over the bed, said to Quail, \"Tell Mr. McClane what you told us.\" To McClane he said, \"Listen closely.\" The gray-green eyes of the man lying supine in the bed focused on McClane's face. The eyes, he observed uneasily, had become hard; they had a polished, inorganic quality, like semi-precious tumbled stones. He was not sure that he liked what he saw; the brilliance was too cold. \"What do you want now?\" Quail said harshly. \"You've broken my cover. Get out of here before I take you all apart.\" He studied McClane. \"Especially you,\" he continued. \"You're in charge of this counter-operation.\"\nLowe said, \"How long were you on Mars?\" \"One month,\" Quail said gratingly. \"And your purpose there?\" Lowe demanded. The meager lips twisted; Quail eyed him and did not speak. At last, drawling the words out so that they dripped with hostility, he said, \"Agent for Interplan. As I already told you. Don't you record everything that's said? Play your vid-aud tape back for your boss and leave me alone.\" He shut his eyes, then; the hard brilliance ceased. McClane felt, instantly, a rushing splurge of relief.\nLowe said quietly, \"This is a tough man, Mr. McClane.\" \"He won't be,\" McClane said, \"after we arrange for him to lose his memory-chain again. He'll be as meek as before.\" To Quail he said, \"So this is why you wanted to go to Mars so terribly bad.\" Without opening his eyes Quail said, \"I never wanted to go to Mars. I was assigned it—they handed it to me and there I was: stuck. Oh yeah, I admit I was curious about it; who wouldn't be?\" Again he opened his eyes and surveyed the three of them, McClane in particular. \"Quite a truth drug you've got here; it brought up things I had absolutely no memory of.\" He pondered. \"I wonder about Kirsten,\" he said, half to himself. \"Could she be in on it? An Interplan contact keeping an eye on me... to be certain I didn't regain my memory? No wonder she's been so derisive about my wanting to go there.\" Faintly, he smiled; the smile—one of understanding—disappeared almost at once.\nMcClane said, \"Please believe me, Mr. Quail; we stumbled onto this entirely by accident. In the work we do—\" \"I believe you,\" Quail said. He seemed tired, now; the drug was continuing to pull him under, deeper and deeper. \"Where did I say I'd been?\" he murmured. \"Mars? Hard to remember—I know I'd like to see it; so would everybody else. But me—\" His voice trailed off. \"Just a clerk, a nothing clerk.\"\nStraightening up, Lowe said to his superior. \"He wants a false memory implanted that corresponds to a trip he actually took. And a false reason which is the real reason. He's telling the truth; he's a long way down in the narkidrine. The trip is very vivid in his mind—at least under sedation. But apparently he doesn't recall it otherwise. Someone, probably at a government military-sciences lab, erased his conscious memories; all he knew was that going to Mars meant something special to him, and so did being a secret agent. They couldn't erase that; it's not a memory but a desire, undoubtedly the same one that motivated him to volunteer for the assignment in the first place.\" The other technician, Keeler, said to McClane, \"What do we do? Graft a false memory-pattern over the real memory? There's no telling what the results would be; he might remember some of the genuine trip, and the confusion might bring on a psychotic interlude. He'd have to hold two opposite premises in his mind simultaneously: that he went to Mars and that he didn't. That he's a genuine agent for Interplan and he's not, that it's spurious. I think we ought to revive him without any false memory implantation and send him out of here; this is hot.\" \"Agreed,\" McClane said. A thought came to him. \"Can you predict what he'll remember when he comes out of sedation?\" \"Impossible to tell,\" Lowe said. \"He probably will have some dim, diffuse memory of his actual trip, now. And he'd probably be in grave doubt as to its validity; he'd probably decide our programming slipped a gear-tooth. And he'd remember coming here; that wouldn't be erased—unless you want it erased.\" \"The less we mess with this man,\" McClane said, \"the better I like it. This is nothing for us to fool around with; we've been foolish enough to—or unlucky enough to—uncover a genuine Interplan spy who has a cover so perfect that up to now even he didn't know what he was—or rather is.\" The sooner they washed their hands of the man calling himself Douglas Quail the better. \"Are you going to plant packets Three and Sixty-two in his conapt?\" Lowe said. \"No,\" McClane said. \"And we're going to return half his fee.\" \"'Half'! Why half?\"\nMcClane said lamely, \"It seems to be a good compromise.\"\nAs the cab carried him back to his conapt at the residential end of Chicago, Douglas Quail said to himself, It's sure good to be back on Terra. Already the month-long period on Mars had begun to waver in his memory; he had only an image of profound gaping craters, an ever-present ancient erosion of hills, of vitality, of motion itself. A world of dust where little happened, where a good part of the day was spent checking and rechecking one's portable oxygen source. And then the life forms, the unassuming and modest gray-brown cacti and maw-worms. As a matter of fact he had brought back several moribund examples of Martian fauna; he had smuggled them through customs. After all, they posed no menace; they couldn't survive in Earth's heavy atmosphere. Reaching into his coat pocket, he rummaged for the container of Martian maw-worms— And found an envelope instead. Lifting it out, he discovered, to his perplexity, that it contained five hundred and seventy poscreds, in cred bills of low denomination. Where'd I get this? he asked himself. Didn't I spend every 'cred I had on my trip? With the money came a slip of paper marked: One-half fee ret'd. By McClane. And then the date. Today's date. \"Recall,\" he said aloud. \"Recall what, sir or madam?\" the robot driver of the cab inquired respectfully. \"Do you have a phone book?\" Quail demanded. \"Certainly, sir or madam.\" A slot opened; from it slid a microtape phone book for Cook County. \"It's spelled oddly,\" Quail said as he leafed through the pages of the yellow section. He felt fear, then; abiding fear. \"Here it is,\" he said. \"Take me there, to Rekal, Incorporated. I've changed my mind; I don't want to go home.\" \"Yes, sir or madam, as the case may be,\" the driver said. A moment later the cab was zipping back in the opposite direction. \"May I make use of your phone?\" he asked. \"Be my guest,\" the robot driver said. And presented a shiny new emperor 3-D color phone to him. He dialed his own conapt. And after a pause found himself confronted by a miniature but chillingly realistic image of Kirsten on the small screen. \"I've been to Mars,\" he said to her. \"You're drunk.\" Her lips writhed scornfully. \"Or worse.\" \" 's God's truth.\" \"When?\" she demanded. \"I don't know.\" He felt confused. \"A simulated trip, I think. By means of one of those artificial or extra-factual or whatever it is memory places. It didn't take.\"\nKirsten said witheringly, \"You are drunk.\" And broke the connection at her end. He hung up, then, feeling his face flush. Always the same tone, he said hotly to himself. Always the retort, as if she knows everything and I know nothing. What a marriage. Keerist, he thought dismally. A moment later the cab stopped at the curb before a modern, very attractive little pink building, over which a shifting polychromatic neon sign read: REKAL, INCORPORATED. The receptionist, chic and bare from the waist up, started in surprise, then gained masterful control of herself. \"Oh, hello, Mr. Quail,\" she said nervously. \"H-how are you? Did you forget something?\" \"The rest of my fee back,\" he said. More composed now, the receptionist said, \"Fee? I think you are mistaken, Mr. Quail. You were here discussing the feasibility of an extra-factual trip for you, but—\" She shrugged her smooth pale shoulders. \"As I understand it, no trip was taken.\" Quail said, \"I remember everything, miss. My letter to Rekal, Incorporated, which started this whole business off. I remember my arrival here, my visit with Mr. McClane. Then the two lab technicians taking me in tow and administering a drug to put me out.\" No wonder the firm had returned half his fee. The false memory of his \"trip to Mars\" hadn't taken—at least not entirely, not as he had been assured. \"Mr. Quail,\" the girl said, \"although you are a minor clerk you are a good-looking man and it spoils your features to become angry. If it would make you feel any better, I might, ahem, let you take me out...\" He felt furious, then. \"I remember you,\" he said savagely. \"For instance the fact that your breasts are sprayed blue; that stuck in my mind. And I remember Mr. McClane's promise that if I remembered my visit to Rekal, Incorporated I'd receive my money back in full. Where is Mr. McClane?\" After a delay—probably as long as they could manage—he found himself once more seated facing the imposing walnut desk, exactly as he had been an hour or so earlier in the day. \"Some technique you have,\" Quail said sardonically. His disappointment—and resentment—was enormous, by now. \"My so-called 'memory' of a trip to Mars as an undercover agent for Interplan is hazy and vague and shot full of contradictions. And I clearly remember my dealings here with you people. I ought to take this to the Better Business Bureau.\" He was burning angry, at this point; his sense of being cheated had overwhelmed him, had destroyed his customary aversion to participating in a public squabble. Looking morose, as well as cautious, McClane said, \"We capitulate, Quail. We'll refund the balance of your fee. I fully concede the fact that we did absolutely nothing for you.\" His tone was resigned.\nQuail said accusingly, \"You didn't even provide me with the various artifacts that you claimed would 'prove' to me I had been on Mars. All that song-and-dance you went into—it hasn't materialized into a damn thing. Not even a ticket stub. Nor postcards. Nor passport. Nor proof of immunization shots. Nor—\" \"Listen, Quail,\" McClane said. \"Suppose I told you—\" He broke off. \"Let it go.\" He pressed a button on his intercom. \"Shirley, will you disburse five hundred and seventy more 'creds in the form of a cashier's check made out to Douglas Quail? Thank you.\" He released the button, then glared at Quail. Presently the check appeared; the receptionist placed it before McClane and once more vanished out of sight, leaving the two men alone, still facing each other across the surface of the massive walnut desk. \"Let me give you a word of advice,\" McClane said as he signed the check and passed it over. \"Don't discuss your, ahem, recent trip to Mars with anyone.\" \"What trip?\" \"Well, that's the thing.\" Doggedly, McClane said, \"The trip you partially remember. Act as if you don't remember; pretend it never took place. Don't ask me why; just take my advice: it'll be better for all of us.\" He had begun to perspire. Freely. \"Now, Mr. Quail, I have other business, other clients to see.\" He rose, showed Quail to the door. Quail said, as he opened the door, \"A firm that turns out such bad work shouldn't have any clients at all.\" He shut the door behind him. On the way home in the cab Quail pondered the wording of his letter of complaint to the Better Business Bureau, Terra Division. As soon as he could get to his typewriter he'd get started; it was clearly his duty to warn other people away from Rekal, Incorporated. When he got back to his conapt he seated himself before his Hermes Rocket portable, opened the drawers and rummaged for carbon paper—and noticed a small, familiar box. A box which he had carefully filled on Mars with Martian fauna and later smuggled through customs. Opening the box he saw, to his disbelief, six dead maw-worms and several varieties of the unicellular life on which the Martian worms fed. The protozoa were dried-up, dusty, but he recognized them; it had taken him an entire day picking among the vast dark alien boulders to find them. A wonderful, illuminated journey of discovery. But I didn't go to Mars, he realized. Yet on the other hand— Kirsten appeared at the doorway to the room, an armload of pale brown groceries gripped. \"Why are you home in the middle of the day?\" Her voice, in an eternity of sameness, was accusing. \"Did I go to Mars?\" he asked her. \"You would know.\" \"No, of course you didn't go to Mars; you would know that, I would think. Aren't you always bleating about going?\" He said, \"By God, I think I went.\" After a pause he added, \"And simultaneously I think I didn't go.\" \"Make up your mind.\" \"How can I?\" He gestured. \"I have both memory-tracks grafted inside my head; one is real and one isn't but I can't tell which is which. Why can't I rely on you? They haven't tinkered with you.\" She could do this much for him at least—even if she never did anything else. Kirsten said in a level, controlled voice, \"Doug, if you don't pull yourself together, we're through. I'm going to leave you.\" \"I'm in trouble.\" His voice came out husky and coarse. And shaking. \"Probably I'm heading into a psychotic episode; I hope not, but—maybe that's it. It would explain everything, anyhow.\" Setting down the bag of groceries, Kirsten stalked to the closet. \"I was not kidding,\" she said to him quietly. She brought out a coat, got it on, walked back to the door of the conapt. \"I'll phone you one of these days soon,\" she said tonelessly. \"This is goodbye, Doug. I hope you pull out of this eventually; I really pray you do. For your sake.\" \"Wait,\" he said desperately. \"Just tell me and make it absolute; I did go or I didn't—tell me which one.\" But they may have altered your memory-track also, he realized. The door closed. His wife had left. Finally! A voice behind him said, \"Well, that's that. Now put up your hands, Quail. And also please turn around and face this way.\" He turned, instinctively, without raising his hands. The man who faced him wore the plum uniform of the Interplan Police Agency, and his gun appeared to be UN issue. And, for some odd reason, he seemed familiar to Quail; familiar in a blurred, distorted fashion which he could not pin down. So, jerkily, he raised his hands. \"You remember,\" the policeman said, \"your trip to Mars. We know all your actions today and all your thoughts—in particular your very important thoughts on the trip home from Rekal, Incorporated.\" He explained, \"We have a tele-transmitter wired within your skull; it keeps us constantly informed.\"\nA telepathic transmitter; use of a living plasma that had been discovered in Luna. He shuddered with self-aversion. The thing lived inside him, within his own brain, feeding, listening, feeding. But the Interplan police used them; that had come out even in the homeopapes. So this was probably true, dismal as it was. \"Why me?\" Quail said huskily. What had he done—or thought? And what did this have to do with Rekal, Incorporated? \"Fundamentally,\" the Interplan cop said, \"this has nothing to do with Rekal; it's between you and us.\" He tapped his right ear. \"I'm still picking up your mentational processes by way of your cephalic transmitter.\" In the man's ear Quail saw a small white-plastic plug. \"So I have to warn you: anything you think may be held against you.\" He smiled. \"Not that it matters now; you've already thought and spoken yourself into oblivion. What's annoying is the fact that under narkidrine at Rekal, Incorporated you told them, their technicians and the owner, Mr. McClane, about your trip—where you went, for whom, some of what you did. They're very frightened. They wish they had never laid eyes on you.\" He added reflectively, \"They're right.\" Quail said, \"I never made any trip. It's a false memory-chain improperly planted in me by McClane's technicians.\" But then he thought of the box, in his desk drawer, containing the Martian life forms. And the trouble and hardship he had had gathering them. The memory seemed real. And the box of life forms; that certainly was real. Unless McClane had planted it. Perhaps this was one of the \"proofs\" which McClane had talked glibly about. The memory of my trip to Mars, he thought, doesn't convince me—but unfortunately it has convinced the Interplan Police Agency. They think I really went to Mars and they think I at least partially realize it. \"We not only know you went to Mars,\" the Interplan cop agreed, in answer to his thoughts, \"but we know that you now remember enough to be difficult for us. And there's no use expunging your conscious memory of all this, because if we do you'll simply show up at Rekal, Incorporated again and start over. And we can't do anything about McClane and his operation because we have no jurisdiction over anyone except our own people. Anyhow, McClane hasn't committed any crime.\" He eyed Quail, \"Nor, technically, have you. You didn't go to Rekal, Incorporated with the idea of regaining your memory; you went, as we realize, for the usual reason people go there—a love by plain, dull people for adventure.\" He added, \"Unfortunately you're not plain, not dull, and you've already had too much excitement; the last thing in the universe you needed was a course from Rekal, Incorporated. Nothing could have been more lethal for you or for us. And, for that matter, for McClane.\" Quail said, \"Why is it 'difficult' for you if I remember my trip—my alleged trip—and what I did there?\" \"Because,\" the Interplan harness bull said, \"what you did is not in accord with our great white all- protecting father public image. You did, for us, what we never do. As you'll presently remember— thanks to narkidrine. That box of dead worms and algae has been sitting in your desk drawer for six months, ever since you got back. And at no time have you shown the slightest curiosity about it. We didn't even know you had it until you remembered it on your way home from Rekal; then we came here on the double to look for it.\" He added, unnecessarily, \"Without any luck; there wasn't enough time.\" A second Interplan cop joined the first one; the two briefly conferred. Meanwhile, Quail thought rapidly. He did remember more, now; the cop had been right about narkidrine. They—Interplan— probably used it themselves. Probably? He knew darn well they did; he had seen them putting a prisoner on it. Where would that be? Somewhere on Terra? More likely on Luna, he decided, viewing the image rising from his highly defective—but rapidly less so—memory.\nAnd he remembered something else. Their reason for sending him to Mars; the job he had done.\nNo wonder they had expunged his memory. \"Oh, God,\" the first of the two Interplan cops said, breaking off his conversation with his companion. Obviously, he had picked up Quail's thoughts. \"Well, this is a far worse problem, now; as bad as it can get.\" He walked toward Quail, again covering him with his gun. \"We've got to kill you,\" he said. \"And right away.\" Nervously, his fellow officer said, \"Why right away? Can't we simply cart him off to Interplan New York and let them—\" \"He knows why it has to be right away,\" the first cop said; he too looked nervous, now, but Quail realized that it was for an entirely different reason. His memory had been brought back almost entirely, now. And he fully understood the officer's tension. \"On Mars,\" Quail said hoarsely, \"I killed a man. After getting past fifteen bodyguards. Some armed with sneaky-pete guns, the way you are.\" He had been trained, by Interplan, over a five year period to be an assassin. A professional killer. He knew ways to take out armed adversaries... such as these two officers; and the one with the ear-receiver knew it, too.\nIf he moved swiftly enough—\nThe gun fired. But he had already moved to one side, and at the same time he chopped down the gun-carrying officer. In an instant he had possession of the gun and was covering the other, confused, officer. \"Picked my thoughts up,\" Quail said, panting for breath. \"He knew what I was going to do, but I did it anyhow.\" Half sitting up, the injured officer grated, \"He won't use that gun on you, Sam; I pick that up, too. He knows he's finished, and he knows we know it, too. Come on, Quail.\" Laboriously, grunting with pain, he got shakily to his feet. He held out his hand. \"The gun,\" he said to Quail. \"You can't use it, and if you turn it over to me I'll guarantee not to kill you; you'll be given a hearing, and someone higher up in Interplan will decide, not me. Maybe they can erase your memory once more, I don't know. But you know the thing I was going to kill you for; I couldn't keep you from remembering it. So my reason for wanting to kill you is in a sense past.\" Quail, clutching the gun, bolted from the conapt, sprinted for the elevator. If you follow me, he thought, I'll kill you. So don't. He jabbed at the elevator button and, a moment later, the doors slid back. The police hadn't followed him. Obviously they had picked up his terse, tense thoughts and had decided not to take the chance. With him inside the elevator descended. He had gotten away—for a time. But what next? Where could he go? The elevator reached the ground floor; a moment later Quail had joined the mob of peds hurrying along the runnels. His head ached and he felt sick. But at least he had evaded death; they had come very close to shooting him on the spot, back in his own conapt. And they probably will again, he decided. When they find me. And with this transmitter inside me, that won't take too long. Ironically, he had gotten exactly what he had asked Rekal, Incorporated for. Adventure, peril, Interplan police at work, a secret and dangerous trip to Mars in which his life was at stake— everything he had wanted as a false memory. The advantages of it being a memory—and nothing more—could now be appreciated.\nOn a park bench, alone, he sat dully watching a flock of perts: a semi-bird imported from Mars' two moons, capable of soaring flight, even against Earth's huge gravity. Maybe I can find my way back to Mars, he pondered. But then what? It would be worse on Mars; the political organization whose leader he had assassinated would spot him the moment he stepped from the ship; he would have Interplan and them after him, there. Can you hear me thinking? he wondered. Easy avenue to paranoia; sitting here alone he felt them tuning in on him, monitoring, recording, discussing... He shivered, rose to his feet, walked aimlessly, his hands deep in his pockets. No matter where I go, he realized, you'll always be with me. As long as I have this device inside my head. I'll make a deal with you, he thought to himself—and to them. Can you imprint a false-memory template on me again, as you did before, that I lived an average, routine life, never went to Mars? Never saw an Interplan uniform up close and never handled a gun? A voice inside his brain answered, \"As has been carefully explained to you: that would not be enough.\" Astonished, he halted. \"We formerly communicated with you in this manner,\" the voice continued. \"When you were operating in the field, on Mars. It's been months since we've done it; we assumed, in fact, that we'd never have to do so again. Where are you?\" \"Walking,\" Quail said, \"to my death.\" By your officers' guns, he added as an afterthought. \"How can you be sure it wouldn't be enough?\" he demanded. \"Don't the Rekal techniques work?\" \"As we said. If you're given a set of standard, average memories you get—restless. You'd inevitably seek out Rekal or one of its competitors again. We can't go through this a second time.\" \"Suppose,\" Quail said, \"once my authentic memories have been canceled, something more vital than standard memories are implanted. Something which would act to satisfy my craving,\" he said. \"That's been proved; that's probably why you initially hired me. But you ought to be able to come up with something else—something equal. I was the richest man on Terra but I finally gave all my money to educational foundations. Or I was a famous deep-space explorer. Anything of that sort; wouldn't one of those do?\"\nSilence. \"Try it,\" he said desperately. \"Get some of your top-notch military psychiatrists; explore my mind. Find out what my most expansive daydream is.\" He tried to think. \"Women,\" he said. \"Thousands of them, like Don Juan had. An interplanetary playboy—a mistress in every city on Earth, Luna and Mars. Only I gave that up, out of exhaustion. Please,\" he begged. \"Try it.\" \"You'd voluntarily surrender, then?\" the voice inside his head asked. \"If we agreed, to arrange such a solution? If it's possible?\" After an interval of hesitation he said, \"Yes.\" I'll take the risk, he said to himself, that you don't simply kill me. \"You make the first move,\" the voice said presently. \"Turn yourself over to us. And we'll investigate that line of possibility. If we can't do it, however, if your authentic memories begin to crop up again as they've done at this time, then—\" There was silence and then the voice finished, \"We'll have to destroy you. As you must understand. Well, Quail, you still want to try?\" \"Yes,\" he said. Because the alternative was death now—and for certain. At least this way he had a chance, slim as it was. \"You present yourself at our main barracks in New York,\" the voice of the Interplan cop resumed. \"At 580 Fifth Avenue, floor twelve. Once you've surrendered yourself, we'll have our psychiatrists begin on you; we'll have personality-profile tests made. We'll attempt to determine your absolute, ultimate fantasy wish—then we'll bring you back to Rekal, Incorporated, here; get them in on it, fulfilling that wish in vicarious surrogate retrospection. And—good luck. We do owe you something; you acted as a capable instrument for us.\" The voice lacked malice; if anything, they—the organization—felt sympathy toward him. \"Thanks,\" Quail said. And began searching for a robot cab.\n\"Mr. Quail,\" the stern-faced, elderly Interplan psychiatrist said, \"you possess a most interesting wish- fulfillment dream fantasy. Probably nothing such as you consciously entertain or suppose. This is commonly the way; I hope it won't upset you too much to hear about it.\"\nThe senior ranking Interplan officer present said briskly, \"He better not be too much upset to hear about it, not if he expects not to get shot.\" \"Unlike the fantasy of wanting to be an Interplan undercover agent,\" the psychiatrist continued, \"which, being relatively speaking a product of maturity, had a certain plausibility to it, this production is a grotesque dream of your childhood; it is no wonder you fail to recall it. Your fantasy is this: you are nine years old, walking alone down a rustic lane. An unfamiliar variety of space vessel from another star system lands directly in front of you. No one on Earth but you, Mr. Quail, sees it. The creatures within are very small and helpless, somewhat on the order of field mice, although they are attempting to invade Earth; tens of thousands of other ships will soon be on their way, when this advance party gives the go-ahead signal.\" \"And I suppose I stop them,\" Quail said, experiencing a mixture of amusement and disgust. \"Single- handed I wipe them out. Probably by stepping on them with my foot.\" \"No,\" the psychiatrist said patiently. \"You halt the invasion, but not by destroying them. Instead, you show them kindness and mercy, even though by telepathy—their mode of communication—you know why they have come. They have never seen such humane traits exhibited by any sentient organism, and to show their appreciation they make a covenant with you.\"\nQuail said, \"They won't invade Earth as long as I'm alive.\" \"Exactly.\" To the Interplan officer the psychiatrist said, \"You can see it does fit his personality, despite his feigned scorn.\" \"So by merely existing,\" Quail said, feeling a growing pleasure, \"by simply being alive, I keep Earth safe from alien rule. I'm in effect, then, the most important person on Terra. Without lifting a finger.\" \"Yes, indeed, sir,\" the psychiatrist said. \"And this is bedrock in your psyche; this is a life-long childhood fantasy. Which, without depth and drug therapy, you never would have recalled. But it has always existed in you; it went underneath, but never ceased.\"\nTo McClane, who sat intently listening, the senior police official said, \"Can you implant an extra-factual memory pattern that extreme in him?\" \"We get handed every possible type of wish-fantasy there is,\" McClane said. \"Frankly, I've heard a lot worse than this. Certainly we can handle it. Twenty-four hours from now he won't just wish he'd saved Earth; he'll devoutly believe it really happened.\" The senior police official said, \"You can start the job, then. In preparation we've already once again erased the memory in him of his trip to Mars.\" Quail said, \"What trip to Mars?\" No one answered him, so reluctantly, he shelved the question. And anyhow a police vehicle had now put in its appearance; he, McClane and the senior police officer crowded into it, and presently they were on their way to Chicago and Rekal, Incorporated. \"You had better make no errors this time,\" the police officer said to heavy-set, nervous-looking McClane. \"I can't see what could go wrong,\" McClane mumbled, perspiring. \"This has nothing to do with Mars or Interplan. Single-handedly stopping an invasion of Earth from another star-system.\" He shook his head at that. \"Wow, what a kid dreams up. And by pious virtue, too; not by force. It's sort of quaint.\" He dabbed at his forehead with a large linen pocket handkerchief. Nobody said anything. \"In fact,\" McClane said, \"it's touching.\" \"But arrogant,\" the police official said starkly. \"Inasmuch as when he dies the invasion will resume. No wonder he doesn't recall it; it's the most grandiose fantasy I ever ran across.\" He eyed Quail with disapproval.\" And to think we put this man on our payroll.\" When they reached Rekal, Incorporated the receptionist, Shirley, met them breathlessly in the outer office. \"Welcome back, Mr. Quail,\" she fluttered, her melon-shaped breasts—today painted an incandescent orange—bobbing with agitation. \"I'm sorry everything worked out so badly before; I'm sure this time it'll go better.\" Still repeatedly dabbing at his shiny forehead with his neatly folded Irish linen handkerchief, McClane said, \"It better.\" Moving with rapidity he rounded up Lowe and Keeler, escorted them and Douglas Quail to the work area, and then, with Shirley and the senior police officer, returned to his familiar office. To wait. \"Do we have a packet made up for this, Mr. McClane?\" Shirley asked, bumping against him in her agitation, then coloring modestly. \"I think we do.\" He tried to recall, then gave up and consulted the formal chart. \"A combination,\" he decided aloud, \"of packets Eighty-one, Twenty, and Six.\" From the vault section of the chamber behind his desk he fished out the appropriate packets, carried them to his desk for inspection. \"From Eight-one,\" he explained, \"a magic healing rod given him—the client in question, this time Mr. Quail— by the race of beings from another system. A token of their gratitude.\" \"Does it work?\" the police officer asked curiously. \"It did once,\" McClane explained. \"But he, ahem, you see, used it up years ago, healing right and left. Now it's only a memento. But he remembers it working spectacularly.\" He chuckled, then opened packet Twenty. \"Document from the UN Secretary General thanking him for saving Earth; this isn't precisely appropriate, because part of Quail's fantasy is that no one knows of the invasion except himself, but for the sake of verisimilitude we'll throw it in.\" He inspected packet Six, then. What came from this? He couldn't recall; frowning, he dug into the plastic bag as Shirley and the Interplan police officer watched intently. \"Writing,\" Shirley said. \"In a funny language.\" \"This tells who they were,\" McClane said, \"and where they came from. Including a detailed star map logging their flight here and the system of origin. Of course it's in their script, so he can't read it. But he remembers them reading it to him in his own tongue.\" He placed the three artifacts in the center of the desk. \"These should be taken to Quail's conapt,\" he said to the police officer. \"So that when he gets home he'll find them. And it'll confirm his fantasy. SOP—standard operating procedure.\" He chuckled apprehensively, wondering how matters were going with Lowe and Keeler. The intercom buzzed. \"Mr. McClane, I'm sorry to bother you.\" It was Lowe's voice; he froze as he recognized it, froze and became mute. \"But something's come up. Maybe it would be better if you came in here and supervised. Like before, Quail reacted well to the narkidrine; he's unconscious, relaxed and receptive. But—\" McClane sprinted for the work area. On a hygienic bed Douglas Quail lay breathing slowly and regularly, eyes half-shut, dimly conscious of those around him. \"We started interrogating him,\" Lowe said, white-faced. \"To find out exactly when to place the fantasy-memory of him single-handedly having saved Earth. And strangely enough—\" \"They told me not to tell,\" Douglas Quail mumbled in a dull drug-saturated voice. \"That was the agreement. I wasn't even supposed to remember. But how could I forget an event like that?\" I guess it would be hard, McClane reflected. But you did—until now. \"They even gave me a scroll,\" Quail mumbled, \"of gratitude. I have it hidden in my conapt; I'll show it to you.\" To the Interplan officer who had followed after him, McClane said, \"Well, I offer the suggestion that you better not kill him. If you do they'll return.\" \"They also gave me a magic invisible destroying rod,\" Quail mumbled, eyes totally shut now. \"That's how I killed that man on Mars you sent me to take out. It's in my drawer along with the box of Martian maw-worms and dried-up plant life.\" Wordlessly, the Interplan officer turned and stalked from the work area. I might as well put those packets of proof-artifacts away, McClane said to himself resignedly. He walked, step by step, back to his office. Including the citation from the UN Secretary General. After all— The real one probably would not be long in coming.\nFrom https://archive.org/details/Fantasy_Science_Fiction_v030n04_1966-04_AK, also available here. "}]
